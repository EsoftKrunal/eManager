    <Guidance>Crude Oil Dirty petroleum Dirty petroleum Clean petroleum Vegetable oils  products (low flash)   products (high flash) products  Animal oils   Chemicals Liquefied gas    Other (specify)

Notes: A volatile product is petroleum having a flash point below 600C as determined by the closed cup method of testing.

If a cargo is being handled at a temperature within 100C of its flashpoint, it should be considered volatile. Therefore a cargo with a flashpoint of 800C should be considered volatile if handled at a temperature of 700C or above.

On 1 Aug 2007, a further amendment to the revised MARPOL Annex I entered into force. This relates to the definition of "heavy grade oil" in regulation 21 on Prevention of oil pollution from oil tankers carrying heavy grade oil as cargo, replacing the words "fuel oils" with "oils, other than crude oils", thereby broadening the scope of the regulation.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>It is important to mention the correct products carried on board during the Sire inspection. This is because a Sire with Chemicals on board is considered a chemical Sire but if the vessel is carrying only vegetable oil then the Sire will not be considered as a Chemical Sire.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Port of the last Port State Control inspection:</Question>
    <Guidance>If the vessel was detained, or if significant deficiencies were listed, record the reason for the detention or the nature of those deficiencies in comments.
Note: IMO has encouraged the establishment of regional port State control organizations and agreements on port State control - Memoranda of Understanding or MOUs - have been signed covering all of the world's oceans: Europe and the North Atlantic (Paris MOU); Asia and the Pacific (Tokyo MOU); Latin America (Acuerdo de Viña del Mar); Caribbean (Caribbean MOU); West and Central Africa (Abuja MOU); the Black Sea region (Black Sea MOU); the Mediterranean (Mediterranean MOU); the Indian Ocean (Indian Ocean MOU); and the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC MoU (Riyadh MoU)). With affect from 1st January 2011 the Paris MOU will change to a New Inspection Regime (NIR)and ships will be subject to
inspection on the basis of 'Ship Risk Profile' in conjunction with the 'Company Performance. Ships will be categorised as either 'Low Risk Ships (LRS)', 'Standard Risk ships (SRS) or 'High Risk ships (HRS)' taking into account various factors including company performance, the risk rating of the ship will determine its inspection frequency. Port State inspection reports should be retained on board for at least two years. </Guidance>

    <Question>Name of Classification society:</Question>
    <Guidance>If the vessel has dual class, record the name of the classification society issuing the statutory certificates and the name of the second society in comments.
If the vessel has changed class within the past 6 months, record the previous classification society and the date of change as an Observation.
Notes: A Classification Society Certificate must be available and the periodic annual and intermediate surveys must have been carried out within the stipulated range dates.
Vessels holding an Ice Class notation must be constructed to meet the requirements specified by the Classification Society and the officers and ratings provided with suitable clothing and appropriate training. Subject to the Ice Class notation to which the vessel was constructed, vessels will be equipped to maintain temperature within the accommodation, protect the hull, deck machinery, pipelines, ventilators, air inlets, sea inlets and ballast system against freezing. Means to receive and display ice charts and ice navigation information should be installed. Protection to prevent the wheelhouse windows from freezing should be provided and if the wheelhouse is not totally enclosed, protected locations on the bridge wings and
searchlights on each bridge wing should also be provided. If the vessel holds an Ice notation, inspectors should assess these provisions and provide comments in the Additional comments section at the end of this chapter.
Where the vessel has changed class within the past six months a copy of the previous class latest survey status report must be available.
It is an important requirement of P and I Clubs that the vessel is fully in class with an approved Classification Society throughout the period of club entry.</Guidance>

    <Question>Do the operator’s procedures manuals comply with ISM Code requirements?</Question>
    <Guidance>The Company should ensure that the safety management system operating on board the ship contains a clear statement emphasising the Master’s authority. The Company should establish in the safety management system that the master has the overriding authority and the responsibility to make decisions with respect to safety and pollution prevention and to request the Company’s assistance as may be necessary.  (ISM Code 5.2)
Notes: It is not a requirement that the manuals be written in English. However, if not, the fact should be recorded in Comments.
Key elements of the ISM Code that should be incorporated into the procedures manuals are that they should be:
• Relevant to the ship;
• User friendly;
• Written in the working language of the crew.
And that they should at least contain:
• A safety and environmental policy;
• Emergency procedures;
Emergency procedures should at least include collision, grounding, flooding, heavy weather damage, structural failure, fire (on deck and in cargo tanks, the engine room, pump room and accommodation), explosion, gas or toxic vapour release, critical machinery failure, rescue from enclosed spaces, serious injury and helicopter operations.
• A description of the master’s and crew’s responsibilities;
• Shipboard operation plans;
• Procedures for reporting non-conformities and for corrective action;
• Maintenance programmes;
• Procedures for auditing and reviews;
• Programmes of drills,
The programme of drills must at least include the emergency procedures detailed above and in addition abandon ship, man overboard, pollution cleanup and ship security including dealing with terrorism and piracy.
Occasionally the operator’s procedures are available only in computerised versions. Ascertain whether there is adequate access for all personnel to a computer and whether adequate training has been given to all personnel in accessing the operator’s procedures using one. In any case, an up to date copy of the operator’s navigation policy and procedures must be available on the bridge and officers should demonstrate familiarity with the policy. If the policy is provided in electronic format only, a back-up independent means of power supply to the computer must be provided.</Guidance>

    <Guidance>Note: This audit must be conducted as part of the operator’s SMS procedures. Satisfactory evidence should record that corrective action was taken to rectify non-conformities. A close-out system, which includes a time limit for corrective action, informing the operator when completed and the operator ensuring that it has been, should be in place and the inspector should ensure that the required actions have been made within the required time. Inspectors must not use Operator’s audits as a means to record Observations. Some administrations may permit an extension for this review.</Guidance>

If records indicate that measures have been taken to address or restore loss of longitudinal or transverse strength, record the details and the repairs undertaken in Comments. The existence of doublers anywhere within the vessel’s structure and deck strapping must be reported as an Observation.
Note: If conditions of class have not been completed by the required due date, then the classification of the vessel may be subject to suspension. If a Class notation requires a ballast tank to be inspected annually, record this as an observation.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>A Condition of Class is considered high risk by Oil Majors. If the vessel has a CoC and even if the validity of such CoC is beyond the date of the inspection, consult the office to ascertain how and when this CoC will be rectified. Normally, it is expected that CoC should be rectified as soon as practical and even before its validity date.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>If the vessel is subject to the Enhanced Survey Programme, is the report file adequately maintained?</Question>
    <Guidance>Key contents of the Condition Evaluation Report should be recorded in Comments, including the date conducted, the tanks inspected and a summary of the condition of the tank coatings.
Note: SOLAS XI-1/2 requires all oil tankers, regardless of size, to be subject to Enhanced Surveys. The regulation refers to SOLAS II-1/2.12, which in turn refers to MARPOL Annex 1/1(5) which states that Oil tanker means a ship constructed or adapted primarily to carry oil in bulk in its cargo spaces and includes combination carriers, any ``NLS tanker'' as defined in Annex II of the present Convention and any gas carrier as defined in regulation 3.20 of chapter II-1 of SOLAS 74 (as amended), when carrying a cargo or part cargo of oil in bulk. This effectively means that any vessel when carrying a cargo or part cargo of oil in bulk is subject to enhanced survey requirements under SOLAS XI-1/2.
The guidelines for enhanced surveys are contained in IMO Res. A.744(18). These include the requirement that an oil tanker over five years of age shall have on board a complete file of survey reports, including the results of all scantling measurement required, as well as the statement of structural work carried out. This file may be provided at the time of delivery but should, in all cases, be available on board at least one year prior to the vessel’s fifth anniversary. The file shall be accompanied by a Condition Evaluation Report containing conclusions on the structural condition of the ship and its residual scantlings.
‘Substantial corrosion’ is wastage in excess of 75% of allowable margins, but within acceptable limits. Each Enhanced Survey File must contain a Condition Evaluation Report for each Enhanced Survey that has been carried out.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Although such a file should be provided at the time of delivery, it can also be provided in the 4th year and must be accompanied by the special survey planning document. Check on board for this ESP file and if not found or if in doubt consult office.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>If the vessel is subject to the Condition Assessment Scheme (CAS), are copies of the Condition Assessment Scheme Final Report and Review Record available?</Question>
    <Guidance>The results and dates of CAS surveys should be reported in Comments.
CAS is a separate issue from enhanced survey and although CAS does not specify structural standards in excess of the provisions of other IMO conventions, its requirements stipulate more stringent and transparent verification of the reported structural condition of the vessel and that documentary and survey procedures have been properly carried out and completed. The scheme requires that compliance with the CAS is aligned to the enhanced survey programme of inspections concurrent with intermediate or renewal surveys currently required by IMO Res. A.744(18). (MEPC.94)
Note: In accordance with the revised MARPOL 20, CAS is to be applied to all Category 2 and Category 3 oil tankers of 15 years and older.
The Administration may permit Category 2 and 3 tankers to continue in operation beyond 2010 subject to satisfactory results from the Condition Assessment Scheme, but the continued operation must not go beyond the anniversary of the date of delivery of the ship in 2015 or the date on which the ship reaches 25 years of age after the date of its delivery, whichever is earlier.</Guidance>

    <Guidance>Note: Condition Assessment Programme (CAP) is a voluntary programme to document the quality of a vessel beyond the normal scope of Classification Societies. For vessels greater than 15 years old the question should be answered Y or N as appropriate. For vessels younger than 15 years old the question should be answered N.A
If the vessel is enrolled in CAP then record the following:-
• Which Class society
• Which areas covered (Hull, Machinery, Cargo Systems, cargo containment systems etc) and what rating was awarded for each.
Date of the CAP survey (The date should be that when the survey was actually completed, not the certificate date).</Guidance>

    <Question>Does the manning level meet or exceed that required by the Minimum Safe Manning Document?</Question>
    <Guidance>Record the Required manning and the Actual manning in Comments
The IMO Resolution A.890(21) Principles of Safe Manning addresses the functions to be addressed when determining the safe manning of a vessel, including navigation, cargo handling, safety, engineering, electrical and electronic engineering, radio communications and maintenance. (Res. A.890(21) Annex 2)
The Resolution also states that except in ships of limited size or propulsion power (which are not quantified), the determination of the minimum safe manning level should also take into account the provision of qualified officers to ensure that it is not necessary for the master or chief engineer to keep regular watches by adopting a three-watch system. (Res. A.890(21) Annex 2)
The Administration should take into account any additional workload which may result from the implementation of the Ship Security Plan and ensure that the ship is sufficiently and effectively manned. In doing so the Administration should verify that ships are able to implement the hours of work and other measures to address fatigue which have been promulgated by national law. (ISPS Code Part B 4.28)
Note: Inspectors should review the number of personnel on board against the vessel’s trading pattern and level of  operation and should consider issues such as whether:
• The bridge is being adequately manned under all sailing conditions;
• There are sufficient personnel to moor the ship safely;
• The cargo operation is being effectively controlled (if two deck officers alternate the cargo watches, is the second officer adequately experienced and qualified and are ratings sufficiently familiar with the operation);
• Safety functions are being adequately addressed (drills, ship security issues, equipment maintenance); and
• The quality of rest is adequate considering the trading area and the workload.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>By number of crew, the complement on board will always be more than the minimum safe manning requirements for the vessel issued by the Flag state. However, you must make sure that individually you are compliant with all the officer ranks and also the ratings. For example, if you are required to have 3 AB then you must have 3 ABs holding valid AB watch keeping certificates. If you have only 2 crew with AB watch keeping certificates on board, you are not compliant. Consult office immediately if in doubt.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Are the STCW and flag Administration’s regulations that control hours of work to minimise fatigue being followed?</Question>
    <Guidance>Records should be kept for the Master, officers and all other members of the ships compliment to the specific ILO format.
Given the importance attached to ensuring the proper management and recording of seafarers’ hours of work and rest, it is recommended that purpose-developed software is used. However, the basis for calculating hours of rest should be demonstrated as being consistent with the Conventions’ requirements and, where applicable, with the interpretations of the OCIMF paper.
OCIMF require that the term ‘any 24 hours’ is interpreted and applied literally and is not linked to calendar days or a fixed time of starting work or rest.
It should be ensured that, at any time during the working period, in the past 24 hours the seafarer should always be in compliance with the requirements for a minimum of 10 hours rest which has been divided into no more than 2 periods, one of which is to be a minimum of 6 hours.
The ILO format “Working Hours Record” contains columns for:
• “Hours of rest in 24 hour period”
• “Hours of Rest in any 24 hour period” A figure of less than 10 in this column indicates a day when non conformance has occurred.
• A third column should indicate the “Hours of rest in any 7 day period” A figure of less than 77 in this column indicates a non conformance has occurred.
Inspectors should observe if the records are not to ILO format or have columns that have not been completed unless another method of confirming conformance is available.
Although the regulations only require monitoring of hours to be undertaken on board, it is important that managers ashore have access to meaningful summary data that enables them to monitor the work and rest hours of individuals.
The Inspector should record an observation:
• If “any 24 hours” is not interpreted literally, or
• a lack of evidence of conformance/non conformance calculations, or
• any lack of evidence that managers are informed at least monthly of compliance levels on board, or
• a failure by the manager to acknowledge significant levels of non conformance (3 or more days containing “non conformance” by any individual on board)</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>This is a High Risk area and full compliance is absolutely essential. You have been provided with a Rest Hours software which also has a function to plan your work schedule ahead of time so that you can confirm that the crew member/s will be in compliance with the Rest Hour requirements. Repeated NC for a particular rank must be discussed with the DPA and corrective action agreed to make that crew compliant. Continued NC in Rest Hours can also lead to PSC detention.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Do all personnel maintain hours of rest records and are the hours of rest in compliance with MLC or STCW requirements?</Question>
    <Guidance>Note: The Management System on board must require the recording of all hours worked for the ship. This will include any watch keeping or work duties either during or outside of the individuals scheduled period of work, and any other period of working that disturbs a scheduled rest period such as drills; Meetings; ER rounds; response to alarms; mooring stations or any stand-by conditions on the bridge, deck or engine room. The Inspector should randomly sample completed monthly records for the ships complement to confirm the records are accurately kept by cross reference to other records on board. 3 or more days containing “non conformance” by any individual on board should be recorded as an observation.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Rest Hour records must be filled in by individual crew every evening and no later than the end of every week. The Rest Hours MUST be accurately recorded and match the activity of the vessel. By recording Rest Hours daily, the chance of missing out a particular period will be reduced. Master must make his own random checks to see that the Rest Hours record match the deck log, cargo log, movement record book and other work records.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Does the officers’ matrix posted for the vessel on the SIRE website accurately reflect the information relating to the officers on board at the time of the inspection?</Question>
    <Guidance>Note: The operator is responsible to maintain up-to-date records relating to the officers on board the vessel at any given time, using the electronic Officer Matrix that forms part of the SIRE HVPQ for each vessel which has been submitted to SIRE. Prior to boarding, inspectors must access and download the HVPQ including the Officers’ Matrix. The Matrix must be either printed out or downloaded and used during the inspection to check officer qualifications and experience. In the case of the senior officers (Master, Chief Engineer, Chief Officer and Second Engineer/First Assistant engineer), the actual details must be checked against the data contained in the Matrix and an Observation made in the event of any irregularities. Spot checks must be made of the actual records applicable to junior officers. Inspectors must take into account that where recent changes of personnel have taken place, it is not realistic to instantly update the matrix and allowances must be made. Observations must not be made unless the personnel change(s) took place more than seven days before the date of the inspection. It is not essential that the Officers Matrix is provided in paper form and inspectors are not expected to seek a paper copy from the vessel.
If the officers’ certificates are not issued by the same Administration as the flag State of the vessel, then an endorsement (or a separate document) is required which attests to the recognition of that certificate by the vessel’s Administration. An Administration may allow a seafarer to serve for a period not exceeding 3 months, provided that documentary proof of an application is readily available.
The operator’s policy should ensure that the master and chief officer and the chief engineer and second engineer, are not relieved at the same time and that there is a suitable handover period for all four ranks</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>1. The Crew Matrix is updated by the office at the end of each month or when there is a major crew change (such as on take over).

2. Just prior to the inspection the vessel is sent a copy of the matrix which is uploaded so that you can verify the contents and inform the office if there is any discrepancy.

3. Make sure the certification of the officers and ratings is up to date. 

4. DO NOT WAIT FOR A CRA TO EXPIRE. Inform the office well in advance if you have not received the Full Term Certificate within about 6 weeks of the CRA being issued. 

5. Overlap between Master &amp; C/O and C/E &amp; 1AE is important. If for whatever reason they had been relieved together, contact office as there would be a Risk Assessment and a valid reason for doing so.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Are those officers who have immediate responsibility for cargo transfer, in possession of the Certificates of Specialized Training as applicable to the type of cargo being carried?</Question>
    <Guidance>Officers and ratings assigned duties and responsibilities related to cargo or cargo equipment on oil or chemical tankers shall hold a certificate in basic training for oil and chemical operations. (STCW Reg V/1- 1.1)
Officers and ratings assigned duties and responsibilities related to cargo or cargo equipment on liquefied gas tankers shall hold a certificate in basic training for liquefied gas tanker operations. (STCW Reg V/1-2.1)
Masters, chief engineer officers, chief mates, second engineer officers and any person with immediate responsibility for loading, discharging, care in transit, handling of cargo tank cleaning or other cargo related operations on oil tankers shall hold a certificate in advanced training for oil tanker cargo operations. (STCW Reg V/1-1.3)
Masters, chief engineer officers, chief mates, second engineer officers and any person with immediate responsibility for loading, discharging, care in transit, handling of cargo tank cleaning or other cargo- related operations on chemical tankers shall hold a certificate in advanced training for chemical tanker cargo operations. (STCW Reg V/1-1.5)
Masters, chief engineer officers, chief mates, second engineer officers and any person with immediate responsibility for loading, discharging, care in transit, handling of cargo tank cleaning or other cargo- related operations on liquefied gas tankers shall hold a certificate in advanced training for liquefied gas tanker cargo operations. (STCW Reg V/1-2.3).
The qualification and experience requirements for obtaining such basic and advanced training certificates are set out in STCW Regulations V/1-1 and V/1-2.
The term "Person with immediate responsibility" as used in paragraphs 3 and 5 of regulation V/1-1 and paragraph 3 of regulation V/1-2 means a person being in a decision making capacity with respect to loading, discharging, care in transit, handling of cargo, tank cleaning or other cargo related matters". (STCW Code B V-1)
Note: It is interpreted that a 'Person with immediate responsibility' includes all watch keeping officers in charge of cargo related operations whether the vessel is at sea or in port. This includes 2nd Officer, 3rd Officer, 4th officer, Gas/Cargo engineer.
It is recognised that there are many officers as specified above currently serving who do not have the Advanced Training Certificate, and that it will take time for all officer to obtain the Advanced Training Certificate. All officers specified above must obtain an advanced training certificate by [1st January 2017].</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>1. All deck and engine officers must have done Advance Training in the relevant discipline such as Petroleum, Chemical or Gas. They must also be holding a Dangerous Cargo Endorsement (DCE) for the cargo the vessel normally carries. 

2. Keep in mind, for a Product / Chemical carrier, all officers and engineers MUST have both DCE Petroleum and Chemical even if the vessel is only carrying petroleum or chemical most of the time. If in doubt consult office. 

3. Ratings also must have done a tanker familiarization course and will be holding valid certification.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Are deck log books and engine movement (bell) books correctly maintained and is an adequate record being kept of all the navigational activities, both at sea and under pilotage?</Question>
    <Guidance>All ships engaged on international voyages shall keep a record of navigational activities and incidents which are of importance to safety of navigation and which must contain sufficient detail to restore a complete record of the voyage. (SOLAS V/28)
Note: Information which should be recorded includes that concerning position, course and speed, the times and positions when passing waypoints, land or sea marks, weather and sea conditions and incidents and events including pilot embarkation/disembarkation, times of attendance and connection and disconnection of tugs, times of berthing and un-berthing, hazardous occurrences and accidents. Effectiveness of the radar(s) as measured by the performance monitor(s) should be recorded by the OOW at the end of each watch whenever the radar(s) are operational to ensure that optimal efficiency is being maintained. A numeric, percentage, graphical, or other measurement value should be recorded.
Records should be maintained whether the vessel is on international voyages or not. Records may be kept either in paper format or electronic means provided such information can be readily available.
Log books and engine movement (bell) books should be checked to ensure that they are up to date with entries properly made in ink and not in pencil.
An electronic chart display and information system (ECDIS) with GPS input (provided the equipment is in good order and the datum used in each case is the same) provides a good record of the navigational activities. Where controllable pitch propellers are fitted, the times of significant changes of pitch should be recorded if this information is not automatically logged.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Shipboard Manual Vol. 2 (Navigation &amp; Bridge Procedure)The log book must be filled out after completion of each watch.

    <Question>Does the operator provide guidance on minimum under keel clearance and squat?</Question>
    <Guidance>Record in Comments, the operator’s policy relating to underkeel clearance requirements for ocean passage, shallow water, within port limits and while alongside the berth or at SBM/CBM mooring.
Note: The operator's policy relating to underkeel clearance should be included as part of the Master/Pilot interchange in the form of a written underkeel calculation. The policy must provide a minimum allowed under keel clearance for both coastal, river navigation, while alongside and guidance on the action to be taken in shallow water to ensure the minimum clearance is maintained.
Under keel clearance can be affected by several factors and the underkeel calculations should include, but not necessarily be limited to;
• The predicted height of the tide;
• Changes in the predicted tidal height, which are caused by wind speed and direction and high or low barometric pressure;
• Nature and stability of the bottom – i.e. sand waves, siltation etc.;
• Accuracy of hydrographic data, (References to reliability is often included on charts);
• Change of water density and the increase in draught due to fresh water allowance;
• The vessel’s size and handling characteristics and increase in draught due to heel;
• Wave response allowance, which is the vertical displacement of the hull due to heave, roll and pitch motions;
• The reliability of draft observations and calculations, including estimates of hogging and sagging;
• Reduced depths over pipelines and other obstructions.
Once the available under keel clearance has been calculated taking into account all the applicable factors, including those above, it can then be determined whether any speed reduction is required to counter the effects of squat.
Squat information relevant to the vessel for both loaded and ballast passages should be readily available on the bridge.
Where there is doubt that sufficient clearance can be maintained during any part of the voyage, the master must:
• Inform the operator at the earliest opportunity;
• If within port limits, obtain the latest sounding information, including the nature of the bottom, directly from the local authorities or terminal well before arrival. Should this not be available, the master should request guidance from the operator;
• If alongside, vacate the berth if in any doubt about the risk of grounding. It should be recognized that occasionally smaller vessels ‘take the ground’ – i.e. sit on the bottom - at some ports. This may even be to the extent that the berth dries out completely. In such circumstances considerable reliance is placed on previous experience, as often there is no other information available to ensure that the berth is safe. In such circumstances, documentary evidence should be sought to demonstrate that the operator is aware that the vessel takes the ground at these particular ports and that the situation has been fully assessed, including the effects of stress and stability and the nature and level of the bottom. Adequate procedures should be in place for maintaining services such as fire fighting and engine cooling water.
The wheelhouse poster should be permanently displayed in the wheelhouse. It should be of such a size to ensure ease of use. (IMO Res. A.601(15))</Guidance>

    <OfficeRemarks>Ship Board Manual Vol.2Bridge Procedures and Routines: 6 Underkeel Clearance (UKC)
Courses / routes for the different parts of a Passage are to be laid down tocomply with the following minimum safe Under Keel Clearance (UKC):
Deep sea passages (with depth more than 100 mtrs): Five times thedeepest draft.
Coastal passages (in depths more than 50 mtrs) : Twice the deepestdraft.
Approaches to Port (depths less than 50 mtrs) / Outside port limit : 15%of deepest draft. (Tide and Squat are to be considered when calculating theUKC).
Within port limits : while underway, at SPM (Sngle Point Mooring)Buoys and at anchorages (with or without pilot on board) : 10% of thedeepest draught. (Tide and Squat are to be considered when calculating theUKC).
At Berth in ports: 60cm UKC.While transiting Canals – as per local navigation rules

If the above UKC cannot be maintained for any reason then office is to be contacted immediately for advise. (Section 0030, 6) 
An entry to effect is to be made in the deck log book. (Section 0030, 6) 
To avoid grounding at the port; as much ballast as possible to be pumped out before low water at load port and ballasting to be delayed as much as possible at the discharge port. (Section 0030, 6)
Harmonic Constant Tables to be used to calculate height of tide and available depth of water at particular time. interpolation of heights and times is NOT TO BE USED. (Section 0030, 6)
Calculations to be independently checked by master. (Section 0030, 6)
At least following to be taken into account while calculating minimum required UKC: (Section 0030, 6)
The predicted height of tide.
Changes in predicted tidal height which is caused by wind speed and direction and high and low barometric pressure.
Nature and stability of bottom.
Accuracy of hydrographical information.
Change of water density and increase in draft due to fresh water allowance.
Vessel size, handling characteristic and increase in draft due to heel.
Wave response allowance.
Reliability of draft observation and calculation including hogging and sagging.
Reduced depth over pipe lines and other obstructions. 
Due to certain circumstances such as sustained wind force and direction, abnormally high pressures etc.; available depth, in approaches or in rivers/ canals, may be less than charted depths. Port authorities/ Pilots/ Agents must be consulted to verify the facts and minimum required UKC to be calculated taking it into account.    (Section 0030, 6)

    <Question>Has the Bridge been adequately manned at all stages of the voyage and at Anchor and were lookout arrangement adequate?</Question>
    <Guidance>Every vessel shall at all times maintain a proper look-out by sight and hearing as well as by all available means appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions as to make a full appraisal of the situation and the risk of collision. (Colregs Rule 5)
The look-out must be able to give his full attention to the keeping of a proper look-out and no other duties shall be undertaken or assigned which could interfere with that task. (STCW A-VIII/2-3.1/14)(STCW A-VIII/2-3.1/14)
The officer in charge of the navigational watch may be the sole look-out in daylight provided that on each occasion:
• The situation has been carefully assessed and it has been established without doubt that it is safe to do so
• Full account has been taken of all relevant factors including but not limited to:-
o State of weather
o Visibility
o Traffic density
o Proximity of dangers to navigation; and
• The attention necessary when navigating in or near traffic separation schemes
• Assistance is immediately available to be summoned to the bridge when any change in the situation requires. 
(STCW A-VIII/2-3. 1/15)
It is of special importance that at all times the officer in charge of the navigational watch ensures that a proper look-out is maintained. In a ship with a separate chartroom the officer in charge of the navigational watch may visit the chartroom, when essential, for a short period for the necessary performance of navigational duties, but shall first ensure that is safe to do so and that a proper look-out is maintained. (STCW A-VIII/2-3.1/32)
Note: The operator’s navigational instructions and procedures must contain guidance relating to circumstances when the officer of the watch may be the sole lookout, including considerations that the OOW has had sufficient rest prior to starting the watch.
The experience of the watch officers, weather and traffic conditions will dictate the required bridge manning composition at any specific time. Each stage of the voyage must be reviewed to establish that sufficient personnel were on the bridge and that an effective communications and teamwork structure was in place. Inspectors must take into account the impact of additional bridge manning upon the work load of any individual and impact of hours of rest regulations.</Guidance>

Shipboard Manual Vol. 2 (Navigation &amp; Bridge Procedure)
Bridge manning levels are defined as below (Section 0040, 1):
Level 1 (Clear and Open Waters)
1 Navigating Officer
1 Rating
Level 2 (Open Waters in High Traffic Density or Restricted Visibility, Arr./ Dep. Port, Pilotage, Berthing/ Unberthing)
Master
1 Navigating Officer
1 Rating
Level 3 (Heavy Traffic in Restricted Navigational Waters)
Master (May be relieved by Chief Officer in case of Long Passage)
1 Navigating Officer
2 Ratings (1 Lookout and 1 Helmsman)
Additional Watch-keeper
The master may use additional watch-keepers under his discretion taking into account circumstances such as visibility, use and operational conditions of Navigational aids, weather etc.
Expected manning levels to be indicated for each leg of the passage plan.
It is possible that one course may pass through different watch levels. Therefore, manning levels must be indicated on each chart used for each leg of the passage plan.
During the passage, re-assessment of manning levels must be carried out depending upon the operational status of bridge equipment, Weather, Traffic, fatigue levels etc. (Section 0040, 1.1)
The time and position of change of watch level should be entered in log book. 
The officer of watch may be the sole lookout in DAYLIGHT CONDITIONS ONLY when the situation is assessed and it is established that it is safe to do so. (Section 0040, 1.1)
When officer of the watch is sole lookout, the duty watch-keeper must be in the vicinity and be available immediately if required. (Section 0040, 1.1)
During hours of darkness, the bridge will be manned at least by the OOW and duty A/B AT ALL TIMES.      (Section 0040, 1.1)
Cadets and trainees are NOT to be used as lookouts. Their presence on the bridge is for the sole purpose of training.
Helmsman is NOT a lookout. Additional lookout must be called for when vessel is on hand steering.
Radar and other electronic navigational equipments are aid to navigation and CANNOT be substitute for lookout. (Section 0040, 13)</OfficeRemarks>

All ships, irrespective of size: 
A Navtex receiver.</Question>
    <Guidance>Every ship shall be provided with a receiver capable of receiving international NAVTEX service broadcasts if the ship is engaged on voyages in any area in which an international NAVTEX service is provided. (SOLAS IV/7.1.4)
Notes: The Navtex system broadcasts coastal warnings which cover the area from the fairway buoy out to about 250 miles from the transmitter, or occasionally up to 400 miles in unusual propagational conditions.
Each Navtex message begins with ZCZC, followed by a space and four characters. The first, B1, identifies the station, the second, B2, the subject (i.e. navigation warning, weather forecast, gale warning, distress alert, etc.) and the third and fourth the consecutive number of the message from that station.
The Navtex should be programmed to the stations for the area in which the vessel is sailing and to the type of B2 messages which are required to be received. Message types A, B and D are mandatory, but it is recommended that the receiver be programmed to receive most types.</Guidance>

    <Question>All ships of 300 gt and upwards on international voyages:
An automatic identification system (AIS).</Question>
    <Guidance>Ships fitted with AIS shall maintain AIS in operation at all times except where international agreements, rules or standards provide for the protection of navigational information. (SOLAS 2004 V/19.2.4.7)
AIS is required to be operating while a ship is underway and while at anchor. Some port authorities may request that the AIS is kept on when a ship is alongside. The AIS operates on a VHF frequency and transmits and receives information automatically, and the output power ranges between 2 watts and 12.5 watts. Automatic polling by another station (e.g. by port authority equipment or another ship) could cause equipment to transmit at the higher (12.5 watt) level, even when it is set to low power (2 watts).
When alongside a terminal or port area where hydrocarbon gases may be present, the AIS should either be switched off or the aerial isolated and the AIS given a dummy load. Isolating the aerial preserves manually input data that may be lost if the AIS was switched off. If necessary, the port authority should be informed.
When alongside terminal or port areas where no hydrocarbon gases are likely to be present, and if the unit has the facility, the AIS should be switched to low power. If the AIS is switched off or isolated whilst alongside, it must be reactivated upon leaving the berth. The use of AIS equipment may affect the security of the ship or the terminal at which it is berthed. In such circumstances, the use of AIS may be determined by the port authority, depending on the security level within the port. (ISGOTT 4.8.4)
Where either or both ships involved in STS operations are required to have an AIS operating while under way or at anchor, the AIS equipment should remain in use at all times including during STS operations. The AIS equipment used for the AIS broadcasts need not be set to low power output during STS operations. (STS Transfer Guide petroleum 3.5.5.4)
Notes: If the AIS is not interfaced with either a radar or electronic chart display, it should be positioned adjacent to one of them. Certain manufacturers have modified their AIS equipment to provide a “Tanker Mode” that permits selection of a 1W output. </Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Ship Board Manual Volume:2 , Officer Of Watch state that 
AI is required to be operational when ship is underway and while at Anchor.
Some port authorities require the AIS to be switched on when the ship is alongside. In
these cases, the unit can be turned to low power operation (on I Watt), the unit should be
left Switched ON with the Low Power, even while the vessel is in port.
Automatic polling by another station (e.g. another ship of Port authority) could cause the equipment to transmit at the higher level (12.5 Watts) even when set to low power (typically 2 watts)
When alongside a terminal or port area where hydrocarbon gases may be present, either the AIS must be switched off or the aerial isolated and the AIS given a dummy load.
Port Authorities must be informed and Status of the AIS should be agreed in the Ship shore Safety checklist.
In cases where the AIS is switched off, the date time and position of Switching off and switching on the AIS must be entered in the Deck Log Book The AIS must be reactivated immediately upon leaving the berth.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>The following applies to all vessels constructed (i.e. keel laid) after 1st July 2002.
All ships of 300 gt and upwards on international voyages:
An automatic identification system (AIS).</Question>
    <Guidance>Ships fitted with AIS shall maintain AIS in operation at all times except where international agreements, rules or standards provide for the protection of navigational information.
(SOLAS V/19.2.4.7)
Notes: If the AIS is not interfaced with either a radar or electronic chart display, it should be positioned adjacent to one of them.
See guidance to Q4.26.11.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Ship Board Manual Volume:2 , Officer Of Watch state that AI is required to be operational when ship is underway and while at Anchor.Some port authorities require the AIS to be switched on when the ship is alongside. Inthese cases, the unit can be turned to low power operation (on I Watt), the unit should beleft Switched ON with the Low Power, even while the vessel is in port.Automatic polling by another station (e.g. another ship of Port authority) could cause the equipment to transmit at the higher level (12.5 Watts) even when set to low power (typically 2 watts)When alongside a terminal or port area where hydrocarbon gases may be present, either the AIS must be switched off or the aerial isolated and the AIS given a dummy load.Port Authorities must be informed and Status of the AIS should be agreed in the Ship shore Safety checklist.In cases where the AIS is switched off, the date time and position of Switching off and switching on the AIS must be entered in the Deck Log Book The AIS must be reactivated immediately upon leaving the berth.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>If a bridge navigational watch alarm system (BNWAS) is fitted is it operational at all times when the vessel is at sea? </Question>
    <Guidance>All ships of 150 gross tonnage and upwards shall be fitted with a bridge navigational watch alarm system (BNWAS), as follows:
• cargo ships of 150 gross tonnage and upwards constructed on or after 1 July 2011;
• cargo ships of 3,000 gross tonnage and upwards constructed before 1 July 2011, not later than the first survey after 1 July 2012;
• cargo ships of 500 gross tonnage and upwards but less than 3,000 gross tonnage constructed before 1 July 2011, not later than the first survey after 1 July 2013; and
• cargo ships of 150 gross tonnage and upwards but less than 500 gross tonnage constructed before 1 July 2011, not later than the first survey after 1 July 2014.
The bridge navigational watch alarm system shall be in operation whenever the ship is underway at sea. A bridge navigational watch alarm system (BNWAS) installed prior to 1 July 2011 may subsequently be exempted from full compliance with the standards adopted by the Organization, at the discretion of the Administration (SOLAS 19.2.2.3)
Note: A bridge watch alarm system is a device which triggers an alarm if an Officer on Watch (OOW) becomes incapable of performing the OOW’s duties. IMO has adopted the performance standard as MSC. 128 (75) and there are ships which have already installed the equipment on a voluntary basis. The BNWAS should be used at all times except when the ship is alongside, in Dry-dock or at a repair facility.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Ship Board Manual Vol.2
Bridge Navigational Watch Alarm System
It must be in OPERATION:

BNWAS is to be put on when SBE (Standby Engines) is given prior departure from port.
The period of alarm setting is 12 minutes. The system will be kept ON throughout as
long as the bridge is kept manned AT SEA or AT ANCHORAGES.
? BNWAS is to be put off when FEW (Finished with Engines) is given on engine
telegraph on making fast a vessel alongside a berth.

Records of On &amp; Off are to be entered in the Maneuvering Book and Deck Log Book.

    <Question>Are the Standard Magnetic compass and Gyro compasses operational, properly maintained and adjusted? </Question>
    <Guidance>Note: The magnetic compass must be in good working order and the ship’s heading clearly displayed at the main steering position. The binnacle lights must be operational. The compass must be provided with an azimuth mirror or other means to take bearings. The compass shall be adjusted if a period of two years has elapsed since the last adjustment and a record of compass deviations has not been maintained, or the recorded deviations are excessive or when the compass shows physical defects.
Masters and Officers should be aware that portable electrical equipment (e.g. radios and tape recorders) or items made of steel can affect the performance of a compass and must ensure that such items are kept away from the compass position. A compass deviation card should be prepared each time the compass is adjusted. Separate deviation cards should be prepared for the standard compass and the transmitting magnetic compass repeater, if fitted (Not required for TMC if attached to the Magnetic Compass). The gyro compass (or compasses) should be checked to ensure that the speed and latitude corrections are properly applied. Gyro maintenance records should be reviewed to confirm that the gyro(s) are operating satisfactorily. Gyro compasses should be checked that speed and latitude corrections have been properly applied. This can be done either manually or by automatic input from GPS/Logs. Each of the gyro repeaters, including those that may be fitted in the emergency steering position and the engine control room must be synchronised. Where two gyros are fitted, a change-over device must be fitted and change-over procedures must be posted.</Guidance>

    <OfficeRemarks>Shipboard Manual Vol. 2 (Navigation &amp; Bridge Procedure)
No magnetic material or electric appliances are to be allowed in the vicinity of compass. (Section 0040, 15)
Frequent checks to be made between the magnetic and gyro compass during the navigational watch.        (Section 0040, 15)
The deviation from the curve and calculated deviation must be in close range. (Section 0041, 3, g) 
Magnetic compass to be adjusted by certified compass adjuster every two years or if excessive deviation is recorded or due to physical damage to compass or change in ships magnetic field for any reason.            (Section 0040, 15)
Dates of adjustment must be entered in compass error log.
Gyro error, compass error and deviation must be ascertained in every watch and after alteration of each course and logged in compass error log.  (Section 0040, 15)
Gyro error, compass error and deviation must be ascertained prior departure every port and logged down in compass error log, master/ pilot exchange form and bridge movement book. (Section 0040, 15)</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Are regular gyro and magnetic compass errors being taken and are they being recorded?</Question>
    <Guidance>Magnetic and gyro compass errors should be checked and recorded each watch, where possible, using either azimuth or transit bearings. A record of magnetic and gyro compass courses to steer and compass errors should be maintained and kept available to the helmsman. (BPG 4.6.3)
Note: The error of the gyro should be determined by external observations – celestial bearings, transits etc. and the gyro and magnetic compass headings then compared to determine the magnetic compass error. Where a gyro repeater is used to take a bearing, an accurate comparison between the repeater and the master gyro should be made. When compass errors cannot be taken it is not necessary to state this in the compass error book.
The previous record completed by a qualified compass adjuster should be retained to prove that adjustment has not been required in the intervening period. A comparison between the magnetic and gyro headings should be made at each substantial course alteration and once each watch. Details must be recorded in the Deck Log Book. Some Administrations require compass errors to be recorded in the Deck Log Book rather than a separate Compass Error Book.
The Magnetic compass errors recorded in the compass error book should broadly agree with the deviation card. The Magnetic compass deviation may be excessive at the time of inspection due to the presence of external metal structures such as loading arms, gangway towers etc.</Guidance>

Gyro error, compass error and deviation must be ascertained in every watch and after alteration of each course and logged in compass error log.  (Section 0040, 15)
Gyro error, compass error and deviation must be ascertained prior departure every port and logged down in compass error log, master/ pilot exchange form and bridge movement book. (Section 0040, 15)

    <Question>Has a system been established to ensure that all Charts, nautical publications and other publications are on board, current and maintained up to date?</Question>
    <Guidance>Nautical charts and nautical publications, such as sailing directions, lists of lights, notices to mariners, tide tables and all other publications necessary for the intended voyage, shall be adequate and up to date. (SOLAS V/27)
All ships should carry adequate and up to date official nautical charts, Sailing Directions, lists of lights, notices to mariners, tide tables and all other nautical publications necessary for the intended voyage. An on board chart and publication management system is recommended to ensure that records are kept of what charts and publications are carried and when they were last corrected. (BPG 4.11.1)
Notes: Charts should be in good condition. The paper surface should be intact and charts should be replaced when torn, not taped together. Procedures should be checked to ensure that the ordering and supply of charts, publications and corrections provides these to the vessel in a timely manner. Many vessels now receive the 'notice to mariners' by electronic means, such as Chartco, Digitrack, Digitrace etc. If received electronically, record in comments the method of electronic receipt.
Publications in electronic format may be accepted by certain flag Administrations. 'Block' corrections to navigational charts must be in the same colour scheme as the original chart. 'Block' corrections to ALRS, Tide Tables, Sailing Directions etc can be in 'Black and White' even if the original is in colour.</Guidance>

    <Question>If the vessel is equipped with an Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS), are the Master and deck watchkeeping officers able to produce appropriate documentation that generic and type-specific ECDIS familiarisation has been undertaken?</Question>
    <Guidance>Notes: ECDIS phase in started on 1st July 2012, if a fully operational ECDIS is fitted, but paper charts are retained as the primary source of navigation (stated on Form E of the SEC), then all watchkeeping officers must have both generic training and type specific familiarisation. (Type specific familiarisation is not required if the Generic training was conducted on the same unit as fitted on board).
If the vessel is fitted with an ECDIS system that is not fully compliant with respect to redundancy etc and the primary source of navigation is paper charts, then all watchkeeping officers must have both generic training and type specific familiarisation. (Type specific familiarisation is not required if the Generic training was conducted on the same unit as fitted on board).
Each deck watchkeeper must be in possession of an ECDIS Generic Training certificate. This Generic training must have taken place at an establishment approved by the Flag Administration, address the subjects set out in, and fully address each of the topics contained in the IMO Model Course 1.27, (The operational use of Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems (ECDIS)).
If the equipment on board is of a different type (manufacturer) to which the generic training was undertaken, then evidence of familiarisation of the actual equipment fitted on board should be provided. It is recommended that the document "ECDIS - Industry Recommendations for ECDIS Familiarisation" 
(Published by the Nautical Institute) is completed to demonstrate such familiarisation. Record in comments the nature of and duration of such familiarization.</Guidance>

    <Question>If the vessel is provided solely with an Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS) does it meet the requirements of SOLAS?</Question>
    <Guidance>Notes: Vessels that operate solely using ECDIS must be “type approved” in accordance with IMO Res A.817(19) as amended, and use only official Electronic Navigation Charts (ENCs). A secondary means of navigation must also be provided. The secondary means may comprise:
A second “type approved” ECDIS powered from the main and emergency power supply and operating independent of the main ECDIS and connected to the ship’s main power supply and to an independent GPS input. The secondary ECDIS must have the ENC chart database and voyage plan loaded before commencement of the voyage and must be operational at all times when the ship is in coastal waters, or
A stand-alone Electronic Charting System (ECS). All non-ECDIS ENC systems are classified as ECS. An ECS may use commercial or raster charts An ECS must be independent of the main ECDIS and connected to the ship’s main and emergency power supply and to an independent position fixing system input. The ECS must meet the requirements of Res A.819 (19) as amended, Appendix 6 (ECDIS back-up requirements). The back-up arrangements for ECDIS must have the chart database and voyage plan loaded before commencement of the voyage. In confined waters the ECS must be in operational mode, or
A full folio of paper charts that satisfies SOLAS carriage requirements, corrected to the latest available Notices to Mariners, covering the intended voyage and showing the intended voyage plan. 
The type of secondary means will be decided by the vessel’s flag Administration.
Navigating officers must not become over-reliant on ECDIS. Frequent checks should be made of the ECDIS position fixing system (normally GPS) by the use of other means. Such checks should include:
• Parallel indexing and use of clearing bearings;
• Use of radar to check the accuracy of the charted position by comparing the location of the radar target against the charted symbol;
• Visual cross bearings;
• Comparison of the signal to noise ratio of the GPS system in use.
The full functionality of ECDIS cannot be achieved when operating in the raster chart display (RCDS) mode and thus the system should always be operated in ECDIS mode.
ECDIS that is not updated for the latest version of the International Hydrographic Organisation (IHO) standards may not meet the chart carriage requirements set out in SOLAS V Reg 19.2.1.4. The list of current standards is maintained on the IHO web site www.iho.int
Data input from the gyro compass, speed log, echo sounder and other electronic equipment should be periodically monitored to ensure accuracy.</Guidance>

    <Question>Was a comprehensive passage plan available for the previous voyage and did it cover the full voyage from berth to berth?</Question>
    <Guidance>Prior to proceeding to sea, the master shall ensure that the intended voyage has been planned using appropriate charts and publications for the area concerned. (SOLAS V/34 and IMO Res. A.893)
Notes: The passage plan should be completed by the navigating officer and verified and approved by the master. It should be comprehensive, contain full details of the voyage and be easy to interpret. 
The passage plan should be written on each applicable chart, which may be supported by a conning notebook, or equivalent. . Excessive information in the navigational areas of a chart must be avoided by recording the information away from the track and drawing attention to it by a line or reference letter.
The following should be marked on the chart, where it enhances safe navigation:
• Parallel indexing (not from floating objects unless they have been first checked for position);
• Chart changes;
• Methods and frequency of position fixing;
• Prominent navigation and radar marks;
• No-go areas (the excessive marking of no-go areas should be discouraged – see below);
• Landfall targets and lights;
• Clearing lines and bearings;
• Transits, heading marks and leading lines;
• Significant tides or current;
• Safe speed and necessary speed alterations;
• Changes in machinery status;
• Minimum under keel clearance;
• Positions where the echo sounder should be activated;
• Crossing and high density traffic areas;
• Safe distance off;
• Anchor clearance;
• Contingency plans;
• Abort positions;
• VTS and reporting points, etc.
In the event that ECDIS is the primary means of navigation, the above should be taken into account.
Charted passage planning information should not obscure printed details, nor should the information on charts be obliterated by the use of highlight or felt-tip pen, red pencil, etc.
No-go areas should be highlighted, but should be reserved for those areas where the attention of the navigator needs to be drawn to a danger such as shallow water or a wreck close to the course line. Extensive use of no-go areas should be discouraged. No-go areas vary with change of draft and tide and will therefore also vary with the time of passage. They should not therefore be permanently marked.
All courses previous to the last voyage should have been erased. Course lines must not be marked in ink, although it is acceptable to plot alter course positions in ink where these are frequently in use.</Guidance>

    <Question>Was position fixing including the use of parallel indexing satisfactory throughout the previous voyage and the frequency of plotted fixes in accordance with the passage plan?</Question>
    <Guidance>Good navigational practice demands that the officer of the watch:
• Understands the capabilities and limitations of the navigational aids and systems being used and continually monitors their performance;
• Uses the echo sounder to monitor changes in water depth;
• Uses dead reckoning techniques to check position fixes;
• Cross-checks position-fixes using independent sources of information: this is particularly important when electronic position-fixing systems, such as GPS are used as the primary means of fixing the position of the ship;
• Uses visual navigation aids to support electronic position-fixing methods, i.e. landmarks in coastal areas and celestial navigation in open waters;
• Does not become over reliant on automated navigational equipment, including electronic chart systems, thereby failing to make proper navigational use of visual information;
• Plots historical ship track forward to identify the projected/anticipated position. (BPG 3.3.1.2)
Notes: At least two methods of position fixing should be charted, where possible. Visual and radar position fixing and monitoring techniques should be used whenever possible. GPS derived positions should always be verified by alternative methods. The frequency of position fixing should be such that the vessel cannot run into danger during the interval between fixes. Fixed points such as lighthouses and headlands should always be used in preference to floating objects, which should be carefully checked for position before being used for parallel indexing.</Guidance>

    <Question>During pilotage, was the position of the vessel adequately monitored?</Question>
    <Guidance>The safe progress of the ship as planned should be monitored closely at all times. This will also include track monitoring and regular fixing of the position of the ship, particularly after each course alteration, and monitoring underkeel clearance.

Verbal orders from the pilot also need to be checked to confirm that they have been carried out correctly. This will include monitoring both the rudder angle and rpm indicators when helm and engine orders are given. (BPG 3.3.3.4)</Guidance>

    <Question>Has the GPS been adjusted to the correct datum?</Question>
    <Guidance>Notes: GPS is referenced to WGS84 and it is recommended that the GPS receiver is maintained referenced to that datum. Hydrographic offices are gradually changing all charts to WGS84 and these charts include the legend “WGS84 positions can be plotted directly on this chart”. Some charts contain information on latitude and longitude shift values that should be applied to GPS positions before they are charted. Occasionally these can be significant, and many charts still show the land or obstructions in the wrong position when compared with GPS data.
Accuracy of positions using GPS can be affected, amongst other things, by differences in datums, solar activity and powerful radar or radio transmissions, including deliberate jamming.
Discrepancies in charted positions of obstructions can also introduce significant differences between GPS derived positions and more traditional methods.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Shipboard Manual Vol. 2 (Navigation &amp; Bridge Procedure)
Passage plan state that GPS datum must be adjusted to WGS84.

    <Question>Is there an adequate system for dealing with navigation warnings and are they being charted?</Question>
    <Guidance>Notes: A system should be in place for monitoring navigational warnings appropriate to the ship’s trading area and for ensuring relevant navigational warnings are brought to the attention of the watchkeeping officers.
Such a system must include an adequate, up to date filing system for Temporary and Preliminary Notices, Navarea and Navtex warnings. Relevant warnings must be charted and the chart they have been entered on must be recorded on the warning notice in order that the warning can be removed when the notice is cancelled.
Navtex warnings should be monitored by the officer on watch at the time of receipt. He should ensure that the system is maintained by initialling the warnings received to show that they have been checked as to whether they are relevant to the current voyage. Those which are relevant should be charted.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Shipboard Manual Vol. 2 (Navigation &amp; Bridge Procedure) 
T &amp; P warnings are to be compiled in a folder and kept up to date with regard their status (whether valid or cancelled). (Section 0080, 7)
The status of these warnings also to be updated in Chart Correction Log NP 133A.
These warnings are to be plotted on the charts to be used in voyage and brought to the notice of master and other navigating officers. (Section 0080, 7)

    <Question>Are smoking regulations posted and being adhered to and are smoke rooms adequately identified?</Question>
    <Guidance>The designated smoking areas should be agreed between the responsible officer and the Terminal Representative before operations start. The responsible officer should ensure that all persons on board the tanker are informed of the selected places for smoking and that suitable notices, in addition to the tanker’s permanent notices, are posted.
Certain criteria should be met in the selection of smoking places whenever petroleum cargoes are being handled or when ballasting into non-gas free cargo tanks, purging with inert gas, gas freeing or tank cleaning operations are taking place.
The criteria are:
• Smoking places should be confined to locations within the accommodation.
• Smoking places should not have doors or ports that open directly on to open decks.
• Account should be taken of conditions that may suggest danger, such as an indication of unusually high petroleum gas concentrations, particularly in the absence of wind, and when there are operations on adjacent tankers or on the jetty berth.
In the designated smoking places, all ports should be kept closed and doors into passageways should be kept closed except when in use
While the tanker is moored at the terminal, even when no operations are in progress, smoking can only be permitted in designated smoking places or, after there has been prior agreement in writing between the Responsible Officer and the Terminal Representative, in any other closed accommodation.
When stern loading/discharge connections are being used, particular care must be taken to ensure that no smoking is allowed in any accommodation or space, the door or ports of which open onto the deck where the stern loading/discharge manifold is located. (ISGOTT 4.2.2.3)
Safety matches or fixed (car-type) electrical cigarette lighters should be provided in approved smoking locations. All matches used on board tankers should be of the safety type. Matches should not be carried on the tank deck or in any other place where petroleum gas may be encountered. The restrictions of the use of 'E-cigarettes' should be the same as for normal cigarettes.
The use of all mechanical lighters and portable lighters with electrical ignition sources should be prohibited onboard tankers. Disposable lighters present a significant risk as an uncontrolled ignition source. The unprotected nature of their spark producing mechanism allows them to be easily activated accidentally.
The carriage of matches and lighters through terminals should be prohibited. Severe penalties may be levied under local regulations for non-compliance. (ISGOTT 4.2.2.4)</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>At Sea, all crew on board MUST strictly follow the smoking regulations posted on the vessel.

In port, all crew MUST follow the smoking regulations agreed between the ship and the Terminal.

All shore personnel MUST also follow smoking regulations agreed between the ship and the terminal.
The main criteria for designated smoking area is that it is within the accommodation and that area does not have any possibility of flammable gas entering from external sources.

Smoking places should not have doors or ports opening directly to open decks.
NO MECHANICAL OR DISPOSABLE LIGHTERS ARE ALLOWED TO BE USED ON BOARD EVEN INSIDE THE DESIGNATED SMOKING AREAS. 

ONLY SAFETY MATCHES must be available and used in the designated smoking areas.
Notices indicating the smoking regulations and identifying which areas are designated for smoking should be posted in all crew common rooms, ECR, CCR and Bridge.

A strict search MUST be conducted in port of shore personnel to ensure no lighters are carried on board.

All Ash Trays MUST be of the self - extinguishing types so that a burning cigarette is not left behind.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Are external doors, ports and windows kept closed in port?</Question>
    <Guidance>A tanker’s accommodation and machinery spaces contain equipment that is not suitable for use in flammable atmospheres and it is therefore important that petroleum gas is kept out of these spaces.
All external doors, ports and similar openings should be closed when cargo operations are being conducted.
If external doors have to be opened for access, they should be closed immediately after use. Where practical, a single door should be used for working access in port. Doors that must be kept closed should be clearly marked.
Allowance must be made to permit doors and openings to be open if the vessel is storing provided there is no possibility of gas entering the accommodation and that doors do not remain open for longer than is necessary.
Doors should not normally be locked in port. However, where there are security concerns, measures may need to be employed to prevent unauthorised access while at the same time ensuring that there is a means of escape for the personnel inside.
Although discomfort may be caused to personnel in accommodation that is completely closed during conditions of high temperatures and humidity, this discomfort should be accepted in the interests of safety. ( ISGOTT 24.1)
Engine room vents may be open. However, consideration should be given to closing them where such action would not adversely affect the safe operation of the engine room spaces served. (ISGOTT SSSCL Guidelines No.17)</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>C/O &amp; C/E must check all doors and ports are closed in port.

Crew on duty making rounds must check .

All external doors, ports and similar openings should be closed when cargo operations are being conducted.

If any door is required to be opened for access it should be immediately shut afterwards.

If access doors are opened during cargo operation for storing, they should not remain open more than really necessary.
If due to security reasons any door or port is needed to be locked, you should make sure that safe means of escape is available for the people inside the accommodation.

Engine room vents may be open but engine room skylight and funnel doors must be kept shut during cargo operations.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Is the accommodation space atmosphere being maintained at a higher pressure than that of the ambient air??</Question>
    <Guidance>Air conditioning intakes must be set to ensure that the atmospheric pressure inside the accommodation is always greater than that of the external atmosphere. Air conditioning systems must not be set to 100% recirculation, as this will cause the pressure of the internal atmosphere to fall to less than that of the external atmosphere, due to extraction fans operating in sanitary spaces and galleys.

    <OfficeRemarks>The accommodation has extraction fans in sanitary spaces and galleys. These fans cause a vacuum in the accommodation if the air conditioning is set to 100% recirculation.

The recirculation must ALWAYS include a percentage of fresh air to keep the pressure inside the accommodation positive in comparison to the pressure outside. Suggested proportion is 25% fresh air but this must be monitored and adjusted depending on the circumstances on board at the time.
There is no scientific way to measure this pressure difference. Hold a piece of Toilet Tissue loosely at the entrance door to the accommodation. 

If the door is crack open the Toilet paper should fly outward from the accommodation. If it flies inward then there is a vacuum in the accommodation. 

Adjust the fresh air intake of the air condition till you get a positive pressure inside.

C/E is responsible to adjust  A/C vents to achieve  best possible  positive presure in Accomodation.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Has the vessel adequate enclosed space entry procedures?</Question>
    <Guidance>Notes: Procedures relating to enclosed space entry are covered by, IMO Assembly resolution A1050 (27) (Revised Recommendations for Entering Enclosed Spaces aboard ships), MSC.1/Circ 1401 (Guidelines for Tank entry on Board Tankers using Nitrogen as an Inerting Medium) and ISGOTT Chapter 10.
In order to simplify the administrative process all cargo tanks which have been tested and found to be safe for entry may be shown on one permit, but the permit must record the readings for each compartment and the same entry procedures must be applied for each compartment entered.
Under such circumstances compartments should be tagged to indicate which are safe to enter and which are not and rigorous control must be in place to ensure that permits are cancelled and the tags changed when entry has been completed.
To be considered safe for entry a reading of not more than 1% LFL must be obtained on suitable monitoring equipment.
Entry into a compartment which has not be cleaned or proved safe for entry must only be considered in an emergency situation. The operator should be involved in any decision to enter such a compartment. The use of personal analyzers capable of continuously monitoring the oxygen content of the atmosphere, the presence of hydrocarbon vapour and, if appropriate, toxic vapour is strongly recommended.
Permission to work should only be given for a period sufficient to complete the task. Under no circumstances should the period exceed one day. NB: The term “one day” means a duration which must not exceed 12 hours.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>A Risk assessment should be carried out prior to entering a tank or other enclosed space.

The entry into space that has not been proved safe for entry should only be considered in an emergency situation when no practical alternative exists. In this highly hazardous situation, it is essential that permission is obtained from the company and a safety system of work agreed.
Complete Enclosed space entry permit with all detailed information and duly signed by Master and Responsible officers , Person supervising entry and team leader.
 
The Entry Permit should contain a clear indication as to its maximum period of validity which, in any event, should not exceed  a normal working day. ( 8 hours )</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Are pump room entry procedures being complied with?</Question>
    <Guidance>Cargo pumprooms are to be considered as enclosed spaces and the requirements of this Chapter should be followed to the maximum extent possible. However, because of their location, design and operational need for the space to be routinely entered by personnel, pumprooms present a particular hazard and therefore necessitate special precautions, which are described in the following Sections.  (ISGOTT 10.10)
Before anyone enters a pumproom, it should be thoroughly ventilated, the oxygen content of the atmosphere should be verified and the atmosphere checked for the presence of hydrocarbons and any toxic gas associated with the cargo being handled.
Only where a fixed gas detection system is correctly calibrated and tested and provides gas readings as a percentage LFL (%LFL) to a level of accuracy equivalent to portable gas instruments, at representative locations within the pumproom, should it be used to provide information for safe entry into the space.
Formal procedures should be in place to control pumproom entry. The procedure used should be based on a risk assessment, should ensure that risk mitigation measures are followed, and that entries into the space are recorded.
A communications system should provide links between the pumproom, navigation bridge, engine room and cargo control room. In addition, audible and visual repeaters for essential alarm systems, such as the general alarm and the fixed extinguishing system alarm, should be provided within the pumproom.
Arrangements should be established to enable effective communication to be maintained at all times between personnel within the pumproom and those outside. Regular communication checks should be made at pre-agreed intervals and failure to respond should be cause to raise the alarm.
VHF/UHF communication should not be used as a primary communication method where it is known that reception may not be reliable or practicable due to noise. Where communication by VHF/UHF is difficult, it is recommended that a standby person is positioned on the pumproom top and that a visual and remote communication procedure is put in place.
The frequency of pumproom entry for routine inspection purposes during cargo operations should be reviewed with a view to minimising personnel exposure. Notices should be displayed at the pumproom entrance prohibiting entry without formal permission.    (ISGOTT 10.10.2)
Note: For the purpose of this question a pumproom may either be a Cargo pumproom, Ballast pumproom, or Fuel oil transfer Pumproom. </Guidance>

    <Question>Are portable gas and oxygen analyser appropriate to the cargoes being carried and are they in good order and is there a record of regular testing and calibration?</Question>
    <Guidance>Tankers shall be equipped with at least one portable instrument for measuring oxygen and one for measuring flammable vapour concentrations, together with a sufficient set of spares. Suitable means shall be provided for the calibration of such instruments. (SOLAS II-2/4.5.7.1)
Notes: Each vessel should carry at least two each oxygen, % volume hydrocarbon, LEL and toxic gas  analysers. Personal oxygen and hydrocarbon analysers, which can be carried in a pocket or on a belt, should be available for tank, enclosed space or pump room entry. The manufacturers’ recommended intervals for servicing the equipment ashore must be observed and procedures in place for the replacement of parts such as filters, at the manufacturers’ recommended intervals.
Use of a self-test facility does not necessarily mean that an analyser is operating correctly. An instrument may self-test satisfactorily, but then fail to register a lack of oxygen or the presence of gas. The only way to be sure that a machine is operating satisfactorily is to use a sample check gas.</Guidance>

    <Question>On vessels fitted with an inert gas system, are instruments capable of measuring hydrocarbon content in an oxygen deficient atmosphere available and in good order?</Question>
    <Guidance>Notes: Vessels equipped with inert gas should in addition to the analysers in question 5.31 carry two analysers capable of measuring hydrocarbon content in an inert atmosphere.
Personnel should ensure that the analyser being used for measuring hydrocarbon content in an inert gas atmosphere is in fact capable of doing so accurately. An example of an analyser specifically designed to do so is the MSA Tankscope. Analysers which measure hydrocarbons using an infra-red principle are designed for use in oxygen-deficient atmospheres. If this type of instrument is provided, a Tankscope is not required to be carried.
In cases where a vessel is not fitted with an inert gas system, but does employ nitrogen blanketing, these instruments must be provided.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>The measurement of hydrocarbon vapours on tankers and at terminals falls into two categories:

The measurement of hydrocarbon gas in air at concentrations below the Lower Flammable Limit (% LFL).=(%LEL)

2. The measurement of hydrocarbon gas as a percentage by volume of the total atmosphere being measured.( % VOL)
The measurement of hydrocarbon gas in air at concentrations below the Lower Flammable Limit (LFL).

This is to detect the presence of flammable (and potentially explosive) vapours and to detect concentrations of hydrocarbon vapour that may be harmful to personnel. 

These readings are expressed as a percentage of the Lower Flammable Limit (LFL) and are usually recorded as %LFL. 

The instruments used to measure %LFL are Catalytic
Filament Combustible Gas Indicators, which are usually referred to as Flammable Gas Monitors or Explosimeters.

The measurement of hydrocarbon gas as a percentage by volume of the total atmosphere being measured.

Onboard a tanker, this is usually carried out to measure the percentage of hydrocarbon vapour in an inerted atmosphere.

The readings obtained are expressed as the percentage of hydrocarbon vapour by volume and are recorded as % VOL.

The instruments used to measure percentage hydrocarbon vapours in inert gas are Non-catalytic Heated Filament Gas Indicators and are usually referred to as Tankscopes. Modern developments in gas detection technology have resulted in the introduction of electronic instruments using infra-red sensors which, when suitably designed, can perform the same function as the Tankscope.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Where toxic gases may be encountered, are appropriate toxic gas detection analysers available and in good order?</Question>
    <Guidance>Many crude oils come out of the well with high levels of H2S, but a stabilisation process usually reduces this level before the crude oil is delivered to the ship. However, the amount of stabilisation may be temporarily reduced at times and a tanker may receive a cargo with an H2S content higher than usual or expected. In addition, some crude oils are never stabilised and always contain high levels of H2S. H2S can also be encountered in refined products such as naphtha, fuel oil, bunker fuels, bitumens and gas oils.
Cargo and bunker fuels should not be treated as free of H2S until after they have been loaded and the absence of H2S has been confirmed by both the results of monitoring and the relevant MSDS information. (ISGOTT 2.3.6.1)
The use of personal H2S gas monitoring instruments by personnel engaged in cargo operations is strongly recommended. (ISGOTT 2.3.6.4)
Notes: Two toxic gas detectors are required on vessels carrying noxious liquids. There should be an adequate supply of chemical indicator tubes (e.g. Draeger tubes), or other electronic equivalents specific to the cargoes being carried and they should be within their expiry date. An up to date inventory of chemical indicator tubes should be maintained. Personnel should be aware that some instrument sensors could be poisoned if exposed to high concentrations of CO2.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>The Dräger tube, a sealed glass vial, contains on a solid carrier material a chemical reagent which reacts to a particular gas or vapour with a characteristic colour change.

To cause this reaction, a defined volume of ambient air is drawn through the tube using a gas detector pump. 

Even small quantities of gas are sufficient, and the user can easily read and analyse the result because of the scale marks printed on the tube.

Currently, more than 220 short-term tubes are available for measuring up to 500 gases.

Gas concentration is normally expressed in Parts Per Million (ppm). 
If value of concentration measured by drager tubes is above the value of TLV in MSDS it is health hazardous to human.
 
TLV-TWA(Time Weighted Average):the concentration of vapour in air which may be experienced for an eight hour day or 40 hour week throughout a person’s working life. 
This is the most commonly quoted TLV.

TLV-STEL(Short Term Exposure limit):the maximum concentration of vapour in air allowable for a period of up to 15 minutes, provided that there are not more than four exposures per day and at least one hour between each. It is always greater than theTWA. It is not given for all vapors.
 
Inventory of dragger tubes with expiry dates must be maintained and upto date.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Are hot work procedures in accordance with the recommendations of ISGOTT Section 9.4 and OCIMF guidelines?
</Question>
    <Guidance>There have been a number of fires and explosions due to Hot Work in, on, or near cargo tanks or other spaces that contain, or that have previously contained, flammable substances or substances that emit flammable vapours. Hot Work should only be considered if there are no practical alternative means of repair. (ISGOTT 9.4)
The SMS should include adequate guidance on control of Hot Work and should be robust enough to ensure compliance. (See Fig 9.2) Absence of guidance should be regarded as prohibition rather than approval (IMO MSC/Circ. 1084). 
(ISGOTT 9.4.1)
Note: The OCIMF Guidelines on Safety Management Systems for Hot Work and Entry into Enclosed Spaces (1st Ed September 2008) information paper must be taken into account in the development of hot work procedures.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Hotwork procedures in Company SMS Manual volume-5 Safety manual section SAF-0070 must be strictly followed.

Hot work means any work requiring the use of electric arc or gas welding equipment, cutting burner equipment or other forms of naked flame, as well as heating or spark generating tools regardless of where it is carried out on board a ship, and that includes the workshop.
There are different safety precautions and procedures for Hotwork in different location.

HOT WORK IN CONFINED SPACES. – Enclosed Space Entry Permit and Hot work Permit required.

HOT WORK ON PIPE LINES AND VALVES. - Hot work on pipelines and valves is only permitted when the appropriate section has been detached from the system by cold work and the open ended sections of the remaining system have been blanked off (sealed).
The section of pipe to be worked on is to be gas free to a `safe - for - hot - work’ standard.
Heating coils are to be flushed and blown and opened to ensure that they are gas free.

HOT WORK ON THE OPEN DECK.
If hot work is to be undertaken on the open deck, cargo and slop tanks within a radius of at least 30 metres around the working area must be cleaned and hydrocarbon vapour content reduced to less that 1% by volume and inerted. All other cargo tanks in the cargo area must be inerted with openings closed.
OFFICE APPROVAL FOR HOT WORK OUTSIDE E/R WORK SHOP

If the SMT considers that Hot Work has to be undertaken OUTSIDE the Engine Room Workshop, the Master is to notify the Ship’s Technical Superintendent and/or the Safety &amp; Quality Manager and get his/their approval in advance of the hot work being undertaken.
 
The request should include :
Risk Assessment Form S 132 
Cargo on board or Previous Cargo:
Slops remaining on board:
Slop tank inerted:
Distance from slop tank to hot work area:
If slops are remaining on board and tank inerted, detail the procedure that has been followed to comply with LATEST EDITION OF ISGOTT  with relevant section on HOT WORK.
 
Permits will be issued for one day only. 
 
All the correspondence to/from the Office related to this subject shall be maintained aboard in the Hot Work Permit file as proof that this procedure is being followed.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Is electric welding equipment in good order and are written safety guidelines available on site?</Question>
    <Guidance>Welding and other equipment used for Hot Work should be carefully inspected before each occasion of use to ensure that it is in good condition. Where required, it must be correctly earthed. Special attention must be paid when using electric arc equipment to ensure that:
• Electrical supply connections are made in a gas free space.
• Existing supply wiring is adequate to carry the electrical current demand without overloading, causing heating.
• Insulation of flexible electric cables is in good condition.
• The cable route to the work site is the safest possible, only passing over gas free or inerted spaces.
• The welding return lead should be connected as near as practicable to the welding arc; metal rails, pipes and frames should not be used as part of the welding circuit unless they are a part of the work piece itself. (ISGOTT 9.5)</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Company SMS Manual volume-6 Technical Manual section 0040 para-1 Safety Associated With Electric Arc Welding must be strictly followed.
 
Welding and other equipment used for Hot Work should be carefully inspected before each occasion of use to ensure that it is in good condition. 

It must be correctly earthed. 
Special attention must be paid when using electric arc equipment to ensure that:

Existing supply wiring is adequate to carry the electrical current demand without overloading, causing heating.

Insulation of flexible electric cables is in good condition.

The cable route to the work site is the safest possible, only passing over gas free or inerted spaces.

The welding return lead should be connected as near as practicable to the welding arc; metal rails, pipes and frames should not be used as part of the welding circuit unless they are a part of the work piece itself.
In particular the function and importance of the three connectors in the welding circuit should be noted. 
These are: 
The welding lead.
The welding return.
The welding earth.
 
When working in confined spaces, such as boiler and on plant which is mounted on anti-vibration pads care must be taken to ensure that there is a proper return path for the welding current.
 
The use of properly constructed cable connectors, lugs and clamps, is also of the utmost importance and the cable insulation should be inspected for damage at frequent intervals.
The desirability of using an electrode holder fitted with a switch by the means of which the welding current may be switched off when welding is not in progress should be noted. 

Alternatively a device which limits the open circuit voltage to a fraction of its full value and restores it when the electrode is brought into contact with the work is desirable.
 
The welding transformer is to be kept dry and well ventilated and isolated when not in use.

    <Question>Are spare oxygen and acetylene cylinders stored apart in a dedicated storage and is the storage in a clearly marked, well-ventilated position outside the accommodation and engine room?</Question>
    <Guidance>Notes: Oxygen will not burn or explode, it only supports combustion; however, a small amount of excess oxygen will allow materials which are not normally combustible to burn with ferocity. Industrial oxygen cylinders are painted blue. Acetylene is 92.3% carbon and 7.7% hydrogen, is lighter than air and is highly flammable with a LEL of 2.5%. Acetylene cylinders are painted maroon.
Oxygen and Acetylene should be kept in separate compartments except in the case of the cylinders that are in use, which may be stored in the same compartment. Cylinders should be stowed away from heat sources and should not be in heavy traffic areas to prevent accidental knocking over or damage from passing or failing objects. Valve caps should remain on cylinders not connected for use. Full and empty cylinders should be segregated. Cylinders should be stored with the valve end up. Storage areas should be free of combustible material and not exposed to salt or other corrosive chemicals.</Guidance>

    <Question>Is there a maintenance and test schedule for lifeboat on-load release gear?</Question>
    <Guidance>Lifeboat on-load release gear shall be:
• maintained in accordance with instructions for on-board maintenance as required by regulation 36;
• subjected to a thorough examination and operational test during the annual surveys required by regulations I/7 and I/8 by properly trained personnel familiar with the system; and
• operationally tested under a load of 1.1 times the total mass of the lifeboat when loaded with its full complement of person and equipment whenever the release gear is overhauled. Such over- hauling and test shall be carried out at least once every five years. (SOLAS III/20.11.2)
Note: Of particular importance in the checking of lifeboats is the on-load release system fitted to enclosed lifeboats and the maintenance routines for them. A high percentage of accidents at sea are attributed to lifeboats and their release systems.

    <Question>Are lifeboats, including their equipment and launching mechanisms, in good order?</Question>
    <Guidance>Each survival craft shall be stowed in a state of continuous readiness so that two crew members can carry out preparations for embarkation and launching in less than 5 minutes. (SOLAS III/13.1.3)
Each lifeboat shall be launched with its assigned operating crew aboard and manoeuvred in the water at least once every three months during an abandon ship drill. (SOLAS III/19.3.3.3)
In the case of a lifeboat arranged for free-fall launching, at least once every three months during an abandon ship drill, the crew shall board the lifeboat, properly secure themselves in their seats and commence launch procedures up to, but not including, the actual release of the lifeboat (i.e., the release hook shall not be released). The lifeboat shall then either be free-fall launched with only the required operating crew on board, or lowered into the water by means of the secondary means of launching with or without the operating crew on board. In both cases, the lifeboat shall thereafter be manoeuvred in the water by the operating crew. At intervals of not more than six months, the lifeboat shall either be launched by free fall with only the operating crew on board, or simulated launching shall be carried out in accordance with the guidelines developed by the Organization.    (SOLAS III.19.3.3.4)
Emergency lighting for mustering and abandonment shall be tested at each abandon ship drill.   (SOLAS III/19.3.3.9)
Falls used in launching shall be inspected periodically (Refer to Measures to prevent accidents with lifeboats (MSC.1/Circ.1206) with special regard for areas passing through sheaves, and renewed when necessary due to deterioration of the falls or at intervals of not more than 5 years, whichever is the earlier.   (SOLAS III/20.4.1)
Each free-fall lifeboat shall be fitted with a release system which shall be designed to test the release system without launching the lifeboat. (LSA Code IV/4.7.6.4)
Each lifeboat shall be clearly marked with the number of persons for which the lifeboat is approved and the name and port of registry. Means of identifying the ship to which the lifeboat belongs and the number of the lifeboat shall be marked in such a way that they are visible from above. (LSA Code IV/4.4.9)
Notes: It is very important to check the lifting hooks and their associated structure, in particular the connections to the lifeboat keel. These are occasionally found to be severely wasted.
Lifeboat equipment is detailed in the LSA Code IV/4.4.8 and the general requirements for enclosed lifeboats in the LSA Code IV/4.6, although under SOLAS III/32.3.5 the totally enclosed lifeboats carried on ships constructed before 1st July 1986 need not comply with the requirements of the LSA Code IV/4.6.
Amendments to SOLAS III/19 (Emergency training and drills) and 20 (Operational readiness maintenance and inspections) came into force on 1st July 2006. The amendments concern the conditions in which lifeboat emergency training and drills should be conducted and introduce changes to the operational requirements for maintenance, weekly and monthly inspections so as not to require any persons to be on board, and servicing of launching appliances and on-load release gear.</Guidance>

    <Question>Are hydrostatic releases, where fitted, correctly attached and in good order?</Question>
    <Guidance>Every liferaft shall be stowed with its painter permanently attached to the ship. (SOLAS III/13.4.1)
Each liferaft or group of liferafts shall be stowed with a float-free arrangement so that each floats free and if inflatable, inflates automatically when the ship sinks. (SOLAS III/13.4.2)
Liferafts shall be so stowed as to permit manual release of one raft or container at a time from their securing arrangements. (SOLAS III/13.4.3)
Note: Some hydrostatic release manufacturers recommend that each liferaft is fitted with its own individual hydrostatic release unit (HRU), to prevent the possibility, where more than one liferaft is utilizing the same release, of one of the liferafts breaking the weak link before the second or subsequent liferafts have inflated. Where more than one liferaft is attached to a single HRU, each of the rafts must be fitted with its own weak link. Liferafts stowed in the forward part of the vessel do not require a HRU.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Each liferaft shall be stowed with a float-free arrangement so that each floats free and if inflatable, inflates automatically when the ship sinks. 

It is achieved by means of a hydrostatic release Unit (HRU). It will operate at 4 Meter deep water pressure and allow L/Raft to be float free.
 
AfterL/Raft is inflated and painter is tight, weak link will break at force of 2.2 +/- 0.4 Kn and L/R is casted away from sinking ship.
 
Liferafts shall be so stowed as to permit manual release of raft or container at a time from their securing arrangements. 
Liferafts stowed in the forward part for crew working there at fore of the vessel do not require a HRU.

 IT is to be launched manually and embarked by means of embarkation ladder.
 
HRU must be replaced 2 years from the month of installation onboard. 

Month and year marking shall be made on the HRU when replaced.

    <Question>Are all means of access satisfactory, including the provision of a safety net, lifebuoy and line?</Question>
    <Guidance>Safety nets are not required if the gangway is fixed to the shore and provided with a permanent system of handrails made of structural members. For other types of gangways, and those fitted with rope or chain handrails or removable posts, correctly rigged safety nets should be provided. (ISGOTT 16.4.5)
Notes: Safety nets should be provided wherever there is a possibility of a person falling over or through the side rails of the gangway and should be rigged to prevent anyone falling between the ship and quay. Where the rails provide adequate protection, a safety net might not be necessary.
Regardless of whether the gangway is supplied by ship or shore, it is the ship’s responsibility to ensure that a safety net is rigged.
If the means of access are considered to be unsafe, then the inspector must not put him/herself at risk by going on board.
When a gangway is rigged a notice should be posted, preferably at the shore end. The notice should state that:-
• Unauthorised persons are not allowed to board;
• Visitors are required to show identification;
• Mobile phones and other electronic equipment must be switched off;
• Smoking and naked lights are prohibited;
Lighters and matches are prohibited to be carried on board.</Guidance>

    <Question>If a helicopter landing or winching area is provided, does it meet ICS guidelines?</Question>
    <Guidance>Landing Area: defined as an operating area suitable for landing helicopters. The landing area may consist of a purpose built structure located above the ship's deck (referred to as a "purpose built landing area") or a non purpose built area located on the ship's deck (referred to as a "non purpose built landing area"). The landing area may also be used for winching operations provided that the winching criteria described below can be satisfied. However, where a landing area with adequate size and obstacle clearance for the helicopter in question is provided, landing is always the preferred option.
Winching Area: defined as an operating area which may only be used for winching operations. The optimum position for a landing or winching area will normally be determined by the availability of a suitable space on the ship. However, where there is more than one area identified and capable of accommodating the type of helicopter(s) expected to be used, the ship's master, in consultation with the helicopter operator, should assess the merits of each location, taking particular account of the size and position of obstacles and expected aerodynamic and ship motion effects.
(ICS Guide to Helicopter/Ship Operations 4.1.1)
Generally, it is not recommended to locate the winching area near the bow of the ship. In addition, it should not be located on the bridge wing in the absence of a thorough risk assessment acceptable to the ship's master and the helicopter operator. The winching area should, if possible, be clear of accommodation spaces and provide adequate deck area adjacent to the manoeuvring zone where personnel can muster, and provide for safe access to the area from different directions. In selecting a winching area, the desirability of keeping the winching height to a minimum should also be borne in mind.  (ICS Guide to Helicopter/Ship Operations 4.4.1)
Notes: Landing Area at the Ship's Side: A non purpose built landing area located on a ship's side should consist of a "clear zone" and a "manoeuvring zone" A diagram showing the general arrangements is set out in the ICS Guide Figure 4.1, page 22, while the details of the landing area markings are described more fully in Section 4.3.2 of the Guide. 
Winching Area at the Ship’s Side: Where it is impractical to provide a landing area for helicopters it may be possible to provide an operating area capable of supporting winching operations only. A winching area should consist of a “clear zone” and a “manoeuvring zone”. A diagram showing the general arrangements are set out in the ICS Guide Figure 4.4, page 25, while the details of the winching area are described more fully in Section 4.4.3 of the Guide.</Guidance>

    <Question>If the bridge wing is used as a winching area, is a thorough risk assessment conducted?</Question>
    <Guidance>The bridge wing will never be the ideal location for a winching area. However, there may be circumstances where there is no practical alternative to use of the bridge wing, and in such cases a thorough risk assessment of the operation must be conducted. Only if the results are acceptable to, and approved by, both the ship's master and the helicopter operator should winching to the ship's bridge wing be permitted.

    <Question>Are the Engine Room (Part I) and Cargo (Part II) Oil Record Books (ORBs) correctly completed?</Question>
    <Guidance>Notes: The IOPP Form B (2.2.2) indicates whether a vessel is fitted with a 15 ppm oily water separator and 15 ppm oil content meter fitted with an alarm and automatic stopping device. Discharge of bilges or transfer from a bilge holding tank to overboard through this equipment should be recorded in section D of the ORB. Section E should be used ONLY in cases where automatic starting systems that are activated by float switches in bilge wells or bilge holding tanks. Such systems are rarely encountered on oil tankers.
Transfer from bilge wells to the bilge holding tank must also be recorded under section D 15.3. Where a voluntary declaration of quantities retained on board in oily bilge water holding tanks is entered in the Oil Record Book, Part I, the entry should be made under Code (I) (Additional operational procedures and general remarks); and the heating of oil residue (sludge) as a method of reducing its volume by evaporation should be recorded in the Oil Record Book, Part I, under Code (C) (Collection, transfer and disposal of oil residues (sludge)),paragraph12.4.

    <Question>Do the sludge and bilge tanks designated in Form A or Form B of the IOPP Certificate and those listed in the Oil Record Book Part I, agree?</Question>
    <Guidance>Notes: Details of bilge and sludge tanks can be obtained from Form B of the IOPP Certificate, although the recording of bilge tanks (section 3.3) is not a MARPOL requirement and is therefore voluntary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an engine room bilge tank is used for the purposes of holding engine room residues, this tank and details of its contents must be recorded in the Oil Record Book Part 1 
In Part 1, Section C should be used for the disposal of sludge and other oil residues such as drainage, leakage, exhausted oil etc. and this section should be completed weekly. Section D (Non-Automatic Discharge) should be compiled for the disposal of bilge water as and when it occurs. Masters should obtain from the operator of the reception facilities, which includes barges and tank trucks, a receipt or certificate detailing the quantity of tank washings, dirty ballast, residues or oily mixtures transferred, together with the time and date of the transfer. This receipt or certificate, if attached to the Oil Record Book Part I, may aid the master of the ship in proving that his ship was not involved in an alleged pollution
incident. The receipt or certificate should be kept together with the Oil Record Book Part I.
Where a voluntary declaration of quantities retained on board in oil bilge water holding tanks is entered in the Oil Record Book, Part I, the entry should be made under code (I) (MEPC.1/Circ 640).</Guidance>

    <Question>Are means readily available for dealing with small oil spills?</Question>
    <Guidance>Notes: Means should be provided for the prompt removal of any spillage on deck. Spill equipment should be readily available at the manifold and there should be an adequate method (spill pumps or dumping arrangements to a cargo tank or other equally effective means) for the rapid disposal of oil at the aft end of the main deck on both sides of the vessel.
If the use of a cargo tank or slop tank is not a viable option, an alternative enclosed container with a capacity of at least 2 m3 should be available for the disposal of spills and oily water from the deck.
Portable spill pumps should be bonded to the vessel’s structure to prevent electrical discharge to earth. 
Bonding may be made by external means, or by the discharge hose, if this is attached by means of a flanged connection to the vessel’s structure. Pumps should also be mounted to prevent movement and subsequent damage during operation.
Where portable spill pumps are provided and the discharge is led to a cargo tank, there should be a suitable fixed connection. Disposal of a spill should not require the insertion of the spill pump discharge hose through a tank opening such as a sighting port.
Where dump valves are installed at the after end of the maindeck, ascertain whether opening the valves will actually result in the disposal of spilled oil to the tank. Excessive cargo tank vapour pressure can result in a release of pressure when the dump valve is opened, thereby aggravating the situation. U bends fitted in the dumping line to the tank may allow spills to be safely disposed of without first having to depressurize the tank, but this depends on the liquid level in the U-bend being adequate to prevent back-flow of vapour. The ullage of the cargo in the tank may also affect the ability to drain spills from the deck, particularly when the tank is full and the vessel is trimmed by the stern.
If effective draining of a spill cannot be achieved or if pressure release is required, an alternative method of immediately disposing of a spill should be provided.
It should be recognised that if the vessel is sagged a spill will accumulate amidships and if trimmed by the head then it will accumulate forward. The positioning of spill equipment and disposal equipment must take these conditions into account.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>1. The wilden pumps, suction &amp; discharge pipes and the compressed air pipes must be rigged and tried out before every cargo / bunker operation.
2. Moisture if any must be purged out while testing. This is a common mistake most people make is to hear the pump running noise and then stop. One must ensure that the suction actually develops by feeling with hand or trying out with water.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Are cargo system sea and overboard valves suitably lashed, locked or blanked and are they thoroughly checked to ensure that they are fully closed prior to commencement of cargo transfer?</Question>
    <Guidance>At the start of loading and at regular intervals throughout loading, discharging, ballasting and tank washing, a watch should be kept to ensure that oil is not escaping through sea valves.
Sea and overboard discharge valves connected to the cargo and ballast systems must be securely closed and lashed and may be sealed when not in use. In line blanks should be inserted where provided. When lashing is not practical, as with hydraulic valves, some suitable means of marking should be used to indicate clearly that the valves are to remain closed.
For further information on this subject, reference should be made to the ICS/OCIMF publication ‘Prevention of Oil Spillages through Cargo Pump Room Sea Valves’. (ISGOTT 24.7.2)
Notes: Records of such checks should be recorded in the Deck or Cargo Log Book. Anti-pollution warning notices should be posted in the vicinity of these valves.</Guidance>

    <Question>If cargo sea suction valves are fitted, are adequate pollution prevention measures in place, are valve-testing arrangements provided, are they in good order and regularly monitored for leakage?</Question>
    <Guidance>It is recommended that a device be installed to monitor pressure build-up and determine liquid make-up in the section of the pipeline which lies between the inboard and outboard sea valves. Such a device would both provide an early indication of leakage through either valve during cargo handling operations and enable the leaking valve to be identified. During cargo operations pressure build-up in this line would be apparent from the gauge reading and would indicate that one of the valves was leaking. (OCIMF Cargo Pump Room Sea Valves 4)
Devices should be positioned so that both readings and samples can be taken from a point far enough above the pump room lower platform level that there is no possibility of human exposure to gas concentrations which may accumulate below the floor plates. (OCIMF Cargo Pump Room Sea Valves 4)
The use of a pressure/vacuum gauge, rather than a pressure-only gauge, is preferable in that it will provide a reliable indication of a vacuum in the line prior to opening the sea valve for ballasting. (OCIMF Cargo Pump Room Sea Valves 4)
(OCIMF Cargo Pump Room Sea Valves 4)
Note: Two valves should be fitted at cargo sea suctions, unless the sea suctions are blanked or a spool piece to the cargo system has been removed. Care should be taken that test pressures do not exceed 3.5.kg/cm2.</Guidance>

If no permanent means are fitted, portable drip trays should be placed under each connection to retain any leakage. The use of plastic should be avoided unless provision for bonding is made. (ISGOTT 24.7.4)
Note: Suitable means of draining the spill container to a cargo tank or spill tank should be provided.

    <Question>Are adequate arrangements provided for pipeline draining and the disposal of pump room bilge accumulations?</Question>
    <Guidance>Notes: On some tankers, no provision is made for effective line draining and, in order to meet the demands of certain product trades, final line contents are drained to the pump room bilge. This is an unsafe practice and it is recommended that cargo procedures be reviewed with the aim of preventing a volatile product being drained to the bilge. Means should be available to have the draining system operated from outside the pumproom, at least from the upper deck.
Where lines that have been used for ballast have to be drained to the pump room bilge on completion of deballasting, care must be taken to ensure that such drainings do not contain petroleum. (ISGOTT 10.11.2)</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>1. All chemical tankers have Annex II overboard discharge provision which allows the contents to be drained overboard underwater.

2. Ballast tanks are segregated ballast tanks. Hence there should not be any petroleum product in ballast water. In any case if ballast water pipelines are to be drained into pump room, ensure there is no oil sheen.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Can the vessel check or sample segregated ballast prior to deballasting and are they free from oil. </Question>
    <Guidance>Notes: A sample of the ballast tanks should be visually checked for oil contamination on each occasion before being discharged. Only ballast tanks adjacent to oil tanks or ballast tanks with oil pipelines running through them need to be checked. Under no circumstances should an oil sheen be detected on the surface of ballast water.
It is not satisfactory if numerous bolts must be removed from manhole covers to check that ballast is free of oil. If this is the only means of checking, an Observation must be made.
In the case of gas carriers there is no possibility of oil contamination of the permanent ballast unless oil pipelines pass though the ballast tanks or the ballast tanks are adjacent to bunker tanks. Except in these cases, sampling of the ballast tanks is not required.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>1. Small sample manhole covers have been fitted on ballast tank manhole covers. Ensure the bolts have been greased and the sample port cover can be easily removed.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Guidance>A direct connection overboard from a bilge pump used for the regular disposal of accumulations of bilge water, or for any other oil service, must be recorded as an Observation.
At least two power pumps connected to the main bilge system shall be provided, one of which may be driven by the propulsion machinery. If the Administration is satisfied that the safety of the ship is not impaired, bilge pumping arrangements may be dispensed with in particular compartments.  (SOLAS II-1 Reg. 21.3)
Notes: Any system used to transfer bilge or oily water mixtures for retention on board or discharge to deck, must be provided with positive means to ensure that oil or oily mixtures are not discharged into the sea.
Ascertain that a direct overboard discharge is not being used for the disposal of daily machinery space bilge accumulations.
The ship's side valve and associated overboard pipework should be checked for evidence of oil contamination.</Guidance>

    <Question>Are emergency bilge pumping arrangements ready for immediate use; is the emergency bilge suction clearly identified and, where fitted, is the emergency overboard discharge valve provided with a notice warning against accidental opening?</Question>
    <Guidance>Regulations 15 and 34 (Control of the discharge of oil) of this Annex shall not apply to:
.1 the discharge into the sea of oil or oily mixture necessary for the purpose of securing the safety of a ship or saving life at sea; or
.2 the discharge into the sea of oil or oily mixture resulting from damage to a ship or its equipment:
.2.1 provided that all reasonable precautions have been taken after the occurrence of the damage or discovery of the discharge for the purpose of preventing or minimizing the discharge; and
2.2 except if the owner or the master acted either with intent to cause damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result; or
3 the discharge into the sea of substances containing oil, approved by the Administration, when being used for the purpose of combating specific pollution incidents in order to minimize the damage from pollution. Any such discharge shall be subject to the approval of any Government in whose jurisdiction it is contemplated the discharge will occur. (.MARPOL Annex I Reg 4)
Notes: SOLAS states that sanitary, ballast and general service pumps may be accepted as independent power bilge pumps where fitted with the necessary connections to the bilge pumping system. Although not specifically described as such, this SOLAS requirement is to permit bilges to be discharged overboard in an emergency situation and MARPOL Annex I Reg. 4 above, allows for this.
The emergency bilge overboard discharge must not be used for the disposal of daily machinery space bilge accumulations. Inspection of the ship's side valve and associated overboard pipework should be checked for evidence of oil contamination.
In addition to the SOLAS requirement for two means of disposing of bilges, there is a class requirement for an additional emergency bilge disposal system and this will utilise a sea water pump and will discharge directly overboard. This emergency bilge suction valve should be readily accessible and clearly marked as to its purpose.
The means by which operation of the emergency overboard valve is controlled to prevent unauthorized discharge of oil or oily mixtures should be determined. Positive evidence that the overboard discharge valve has not been opened can be provided by use of a numbered seal, the number of which can be verified in official documents such as the Engine Room Log or the Oil Record Book Part I. Such a method of sealing must be easily breakable to allow the valve to be opened in an emergency.
If the vessel has an ejector as a substitute for one of the bilge pumps then it may be necessary to ensure that the suction valves are similarly sealed.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>1. Ensure this is complied with.
2. Emergency bilge pumping arrangement -the valve handle should be painted red and stenciled near  the valve on e/r floor identifying the purpose.
3. The valve to be sealed with numeric seal and records of seal maintained.
4. As a minimum at hand over / take over of Ch Engineers, this valve should be tried out for operation and resealed. Relevant entries are to be made in the seal log.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Is the hull free from visible structural defects that warrant further investigation?</Question>
    <Guidance>Notes: Inspection of the hull should include checking for any evidence of structural problems including collision contact or distortion from heavy weather.
Class records should be examined to confirm that class has been involved whenever significant damage has occurred or been repaired.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>An inspector usually inspects the hull from the jetty or when he approaches in a boat. Any significant dents or obvious renewal of steel on the hull is taken note of and will be discussed with the Master. If a particular repair has been done as a result of a contact damage or collision, the inspector may ask for the incident report and proper closure of that incident report. This would include the report of Class attendance as well. 

At times, small dents are observed by the Inspector but have not been reported by the Master. This is very embarrassing and shows that the Master does not know his own ship. When preparing for a vetting inspection, at the first opportunity take a good look at the ship`s hull for any such dents or marks and consult office for guidance. Also note that marks on the hull from cargo or oil residues will be investigated by the inspector so make sure the hull is free from such stains as well.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>If any cargo and/or ballast tanks were sighted from the deck, were they in good order?</Question>
    <Guidance>If the internals of a tank, or tanks, were sighted from the deck, record this fact either as an Observation or Comments as applicable and list the findings as appropriate.
Valuable indications as to the condition of compartments such as ballast tanks, access trunks and peak tanks can be made from a visual inspection from the outside.
Indications of problems can be wastage of handrails and ladder rungs, visible corrosion on vertical and horizontal framing, knife-edges on brackets, visible cracking and deformations of bulkheads or frames. 
Leakage from adjacent tanks or valve glands may be indicated by the presence of oil or a sheen on the ballast, the presence of gas or the sound of falling liquid.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Although inspectors will usually not ask for an internal inspection of a ballast or cargo tank, it is possible that an open tank may allow an inspector to get an overview of the tank condition. Usually an inspection is done at a discharge port and tanks are not expected to be left open during such operation. An inspector may also get access to such information from tank inspection reports where inspection is done by the vessel prior to the inspection.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Are procedures in place to carry out regular inspections of cargo and ballast tanks, void spaces, trunks and cofferdams by the vessel’s personnel and are records maintained?</Question>
    <Guidance>Note: These requirements apply to every vessel regardless of whether it is subject to enhanced survey. In the case of oil and chemical tankers, inspections of cargo tanks should be made at intervals not exceeding 2.5 years. Ballast tanks should be inspected annually. In the case of gas carriers, ballast tanks, and void spaces, cofferdams, and hold spaces should be inspected annually. Records of all inspection results should be maintained. These should include a plan of each compartment with all its boundaries and should at least contain details and the location of:
• Structural deterioration and failure;
• Extent of corrosion, pitting and wastage;
• Extent of deterioration of any coating;
• Any leakages in bulkheads or pipework;
• The condition of cargo handling and monitoring equipment;
• Extent of sediment build-up.</Guidance>

    <Question>Are damage stability guidelines available?</Question>
    <Guidance>Notes: Damage assumptions are addressed in Chapter 2.5 of the IBC Code and the stability booklet shall contain information on the ship’s survival capabilities. The procedures listed in the Operating Manual must be identical to those posted and practiced (Q8.9 above, refers). If not, record an Observation.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>The vessel is supposed to have a capability of surviving even if she is damaged in a loaded condition. 

Such damage assumptions are clearly stated in the IBC Code 2.5 and the survival capability is calculated for all anticipated conditions of loading and variations in draught and trim. 

Such calculations are given in the damage stability booklet which is always available on board. 

In addition, it may be possible that the ship’s loadicator also has damage stability conditions entered in its program but all ships may not necessarily have this and it is not a requirement.

Master must be familiar with the use of the damage stability booklet and be able to identify the worst case scenario from the conditions mentioned therein.

If any damage of a lesser extent than the maximum damage specified in IBC 2.5.1 would result in a more severe condition of stability, then such a damage assumption shall be considered.

Damage stability for ballast conditions or where the chemical tanker is only carrying cargo residues need not be considered.

Company SMS manual Vol-5-Safety Manual-SAF-0085-Trim and Stability- section must be strictly followed.

The vessel must also be provided with a Damage Stability Manual approved by the Administration.

The Master should be aware of the worst case scenario that can occur in case of damage to the watertight integrity of the hull.

All tankers have a tendency to sag in the fully laden condition, and hog in the light condition. 

If these tendencies are further aggravated by the unsatisfactory distribution of cargo, bunkers or ballast, unnecessary stresses will be put on the structure of the vessel. 

This effect is cumulative and if made a regular practice can result in structural failure.

In order to reduce stresses to a minimum, weight distribution for various conditions of loading as detailed in the manual and verified by the stress and stability indicator are to be followed.

As far as possible, all attempts are to be made to keep the cargo and ballast tanks topped up to the maximum possible limit keeping the maximum permissible cargo density and company’s procedural requirements in mind so as to keep these tanks free of sloshing and other restrictions.

This manual to be read by all staff involved in the vessel’s cargo operation.

    <Question>Is the vessel free of inherent intact stability problems?</Question>
    <Guidance>Notes: Vessels that have large width tanks will be subject to reductions of intact stability due to free surface. Although such vessels may meet IMO intact stability criteria when in fully loaded or ballasted conditions, they may be unstable when multiple tanks are slack during cargo or ballast transfer operations, or in intermediate states of loading. Trim and stability manuals generally deal only with arrival and departure conditions and operators are not made aware that stability problems may exist at intermediate stages during cargo transfers.
If a vessel has either large width cargo tanks, “U” section ballast tanks, or double bottom tanks without watertight centreline bulkheads, inspectors should ascertain that the vessel meets IMO intact stability criteria by requesting the chief officer to demonstrate, using the class approved loading instrument, the intact stability at the worst case condition. (i.e. All tanks slack and maximum free surface)
If no suitable loading instrument is provided and adequate instructions are not available, the question should be answered ‘No’, unless there is satisfactory proof that the vessel is free of inherent stability problems.
Inspectors should ascertain whether all officers appear familiar with operational restrictions and that instructions are prominently posted describing action to take if stability concerns are suspected or experienced. Record a "N" response and appropriate Observation if weaknesses or other concerns are revealed.
If specific procedures have been adopted to address potential stability problems, these should be recorded as an Observation.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Normally our chemical tanks are not fitted with large width tank and also ballast tank are not "U" shape but "J" shape with center line bulkhead. Thus our chemical tanker has no inherent intact stability problem.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>If a loading computer or programme is in use, is it class approved?</Question>
    <Guidance>If a class approved loading computer is not available, record in Comments how stress and stability calculations are performed.
Notes: Ships of more than 65 metres in length are required by Class to be provided with a loading manual including permissible limits of still water bending moment and shear force; the results of the calculations of still water bending moments; shear forces and where applicable, limitations due to torsional and lateral loads and the allowable local loading for the structure (decks, double bottom, etc.)
Ships of more than 100 metres in length are required by Class to be provided with an approved loading instrument. An operational manual is always to be provided for the loading instrument .
The loading instrument should be capable of calculating shear forces and bending moments in any load or ballast condition at specified readout points and should indicate the permissible values. Ships with very limited possibilities for variations in the distribution of cargo and ballast and ships with a regular or fixed trading pattern may be exempt from the requirement.

Class approvals for loading instruments are made under a Type Approvals process. Type-approval certificates are generally valid for periods of not more than five years. MSC Circular 1221 notes that the validity of the Type Approval Certificate itself has no influence on the operational validity of a product accepted and installed onboard ship and that a product manufactured during the period of validity of the relevant Type Approval Certificate need not be renewed or replaced due to the expiry of such Type Approval Certificate.

    <Question>Where applicable, are officers aware of the dangers of high free surface effects and of the possibility of structural damage caused by sloshing in cargo tanks?</Question>
    <Guidance />
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>This is applicable more to tankers with cargo tanks having a large width and may have multiple tanks slack during cargo transfer. 

The key factor is to keep in mind the loss of stability due to Free Surface Effect (FSE). 

On chemical tankers with a number of small tanks, this may not be as crucial but the principle of FSE must be understood by all deck officers.

Company SMS Manual Vol-5-Safety Manual-SAF-0085-Trim &amp; Stability must be followed
.
Company SMS Manual Vol-4-Cargo Operation Manual-CGO-0052-Loading High Density Cargo must be observed.

It is important to note whether there are any notations in the stability booklet regarding the number of tanks that can be kept slack at any one time. 

If such instructions are given, all officers and ratings handling cargo and ballast transfer operations must be fully aware of same and such instructions must be posted legibly in the Cargo Control room.

SLOSHING - is the movement of cargo or ballast inside a partially filled tank due to the vessel’s movement in a seaway.

Sloshing can cause;

Loss of stability.
Structural damage to the tank. 

If a compartment or tank is either empty or full, there is no change in the vessel`s center of mass as it rolls from side to side (in strong winds, heavy seas, or on sharp motions or turns). 

However, if the compartment is only partially full, the liquid in the compartment will respond to the vessel`s heave, pitch, roll, surge, sway or yaw.

For example, as a vessel rolls to the left, liquid will move to the left side of a compartment, and this will move the vessel`s center of mass towards the left. 

This has the effect of slowing the vessel`s return to vertical. 

Also, the momentum of large volumes of moving liquids causes significant dynamic forces, which act against the righting effect. 

When the vessel returns to vertical the roll continues and the effect is repeated on the opposite side.

In heavy sea states, this can cause each roll to become more and more extreme, eventually overcoming the righting effect leading to a vessel capsizing.

The ship’s tanks are strengthened to withstand static pressure from the cargo. 

Sloshing causes unequal and irregular stresses on the tank structure which it may not be able to withstand, causing structural damage in some cases.

All deck officers must be aware of the effects of sloshing and especially if there are any restrictions on the vessel with respect to the number of tanks that can be kept slack.

    <Question>If the cargo is required to be inhibited, is the required information available?</Question>
    <Guidance>Certain cargoes with a reference in column ‘o’ of Chapter 17, by the nature of their chemical make-up, tend, under certain conditions of temperature, exposure to air or contact with a catalyst, to undergo polymerisation, decomposition, oxidation or other chemical changes. Mitigation of this tendency is carried out by introducing small amounts of chemical additives into the liquid cargo or controlling the tank environment. (IBC 15.13.1)
Care shall be taken to ensure that these cargoes are sufficiently protected to prevent deleterious chemical change at all times during the voyage. Ships carrying such cargoes shall be provided with a certificate of protection from the manufacturer and kept during the voyage, specifying: 
• The name and amount of additive present;
• Whether the additive is oxygen dependent;
• Date the additive was put in the product and the duration of its effectiveness;
• Any temperature limitations qualifying the additive’s effective lifetime; and
• The action to be taken should the length of the voyage exceed the effective lifetime of the additives.    (IBC 15.13.3)</Guidance>

    <Question>Is a tank cleaning plan established prior to cleaning operations?</Question>
    <Guidance>Notes: Adequate planning of cleaning operations is crucial to the successful carriage of chemicals and to the avoidance of rejection of tanks, contamination of cargo and incidents. The two most important criteria are the previous and the next cargoes and these two factors will determine the level of cleaning required.
Planning should take into account the method of cleaning required and also ensure that all parts of the cargo system which were in contact with the previous cargo are cleaned, including the tank walls, pumps, cofferdams and exhaust traps, stripping system, cargo and vent lines, cargo valves, p/v valves, sounding pipes, stub pipes, dead ends etc.
The plan should detail, for each of the pre and final cleaning steps:
• The previous and following cargoes;
• The condition of the cargo tank to be cleaned and whether toxic or flammable vapour is present, or whether lack of oxygen should be suspected;
• Any precautions necessary with respect to the condition of the tank;
• The cleaning method, whether butterworthing, recirculation, rinsing, steaming, ventilating, or drying;
• The cleaning medium, whether sea, fresh, treated or demineralised water, or a chemical or solvent;
• Which cleaner, if any, to be used, its concentration and whether it is to be injected, recirculated, locally cleaned or hand wiped-;
• The washing temperature required to be maintained;
• The length of cleaning time required;
• Slop disposal requirements;
• Wall wash test requirements, if any;
• Any relevant additional instructions, including protective equipment requirements; and
• The action to be taken in the event of an emergency.</Guidance>

    <Question>Have satisfactory column/cofferdam purging routines been established where deep well pumps are fitted?</Question>
    <Guidance />
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Purging of the cofferdam is one of the most important operations to be done when operating a submerged Cargo Pump. This is because the only way to check the pump’s seals and thus the condition of the pumps, is by purging possible leakages in the cofferdam.lf this is done and necessary action in case of large leakages is taken, trouble free operation of the cargo pump is assured. Purging of the cofferdam is also a protection against personal safety when working inside the cargo tank. If a cofferdam has toxic or hazardous cargo leaked into it and is not purged, it could come in contact with the persons inside the tank causing great harm.Cofferdam is an empty buffer space to isolate the cargo and hydraulic oil in a submerged pump. WHY PURGE THE COFFERDAM?Leakage detectionCondition monitoring of the shaft seal systemAvoid that leakages are blocking the cofferdamHOW TO PURGE THE COFFERDAMCAUTION:Venting gas and liquid may be dangerous. Use safety gear to avoid contact with drain from exhaust trap and venting line- Place a suitable container underneath the exhaust trap to collect the leakage.- Check that drain valve and bottom of exhaust trap is not clogged by residue after last purging operation. Stick up with a pin if necessary. Close drain valve.- Check that relief valve on hydraulic control valve is open. For technical details, refer to service manual for the valve.- Connect air or inert gas supply to the snap-on coupling on the purging connection. (Maximum supply pressure is 7 bar.)- Drain the supply line for condensed water.Purging:- Open valve on air/inert gas supply line- Check that air/inert gas is coming out of the exhaust trap vent line. (Cofferdam is open)- The relief valve is set to an opening pressure of 3 - 3.5 bar, so a small leakage here is normal.- Purge cofferdam in several sequences if required- Drain exhaust trap between each sequence- Disconnect air/inert gas supply- Close exhaust trap drain valve- Measure the amount of leakage, -evaluate and log the purging result.Note! Neglecting of purging can result in a blocked cofferdam.The purging form should be filled in with the results from every purging operation. Each horizontal line in the form represents one cargo in one tank from loading till discharging. If a ship loads and discharges some tanks more frequently than other, an extra form should be filled in for these tanks.

    <Question>Where cargo tanks are of stainless steel are there procedures for passivation and pickling?</Question>
    <Guidance>Notes: Passivation and pickling are acid treatments applied to the surface of stainless steel tanks to aid the formation of a continuous passive chromium oxide film. The surfaces of stainless steel tanks should be regularly checked, generally using a palladium chloride test, for an intact passive film. 
Passivation is removal of contaminants from the surface of stainless steel. The most common treatment is nitric acid solution, although care should be exercised in selecting the treatment to ensure that the contaminant is adequately targeted.
Pickling is the removal of scale and oxide layers on the surface of the tank, generally the result of heating the metal through welding or other heat treatments, by the application of nitric or hydrofluoric acid, although other specialised applications exist. The application restores the chromium oxide film. 
It is essential that the passivation or pickling acid is thoroughly removed after the process is completed. 
Residual hydrofluoric acid will initiate pitting corrosion.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Passivation is removal of dirt from the surface of stainless steel.

Pickling is the process of removing of scale and oxide layers which are a result of heating the metal through welding or other heat treatments.
 
Dirt and Oxide layer can possibly cause cargo contamination and hence the stainless steel must be restored with the film of chromium oxide.
Procedures for the safe operation of Passivation and Pickling is necessary as both use Nitric Acid solutions which is corrosive in nature.

 The process describe in the SMS MUST be followed as the use of Nitric Acid can be harmful to the stainless steel if not thoroughly removed after the process. It can cause pitting corrosion
Clean stainless steel in its active state will spontaneously re-passivate over about 24 hours in air. 

To achieve a uniform and fully complete passive oxide layer, free from airborne contamination, a chemical oxidation is recommended.

To achieve this, a solution of nitric acid dissolved in demineralised water is applied for approximately one hour.

Chloride content in a passivating solution affects the quality of passivation.
Passivation usually only involves the re-circulation of a nitric acid solution which is made up in a cargo tank, then pumped, using the cargo pump through the cargo discharge piping and back to the tank via tank cleaning hoses and stainless steel tank cleaning machines. 

The simple nitric acid solution serves to remove any free iron contaminants present, plus any other contaminant which may fortunately be acid soluble, while simultaneously oxidizing, or passivating the surface, if exposed. 
There is no loss of material involved, either from the tanks or cleaning equipment. No oxides will be removed.

Following passivation and fresh water rinsing, a final rinse with demineralised water is recommended.
 
To summarize, the effect of pickling is to remove acid soluble oxides, free iron and uniformly dissolve a very thin layer of the whole surface. 

The new surface can be described as “virgin steel” with enhanced chromium content. 
The effect of passivation is to form a uniform, closed chromium oxide surface film, to maximize the corrosion resistance offered by the material.

Although essentially a purely chemical process, pickling and passivation can be equated to a full re-coating of mild steel tanks, with the added advantage that, if carefully maintained, the passivating chromium oxide film is “self-healing”.
PASSIVATION PROCEDURE
 
1.  Wash tanks to be passivated methanol load ready . There should be no films of oil or fat on any of the surfaces.
2.  It is desirable to steam the tank before and raise the temperature of the tank to 50C.
3.  Prepare a solution of  15-17% actual nitric acid concentration in the tank.
4.  Heat the solution to 55C with help of heating coils. 
5.  Steam the next tanks to be passivated.
6.  Recirculate the acid mixture in the tank for 1.5 hours.
7.  Measure the iron and chloride content in ppm.
8.  If the solution is iron saturated then prepare a fresh solution.
9.  Transfer into next set of tanks. 
10.  Use DI water or potable water for rinsing. Any salt in this stage will interfere with the passivation process.
11. Visually inspect the tank 

12. To conserve fresh water- after the initial 45 mins rinse transfer the washing into a separate tank to be used for the initial rinse of the next tank to be passivated.
TIPS:  Pickling and passivation use strong acids, and normal precautions for safety should be followed.

    <Question>Are adequate procedures in place for carrying out wall wash tests?</Question>
    <Guidance>Notes: Wall wash tests are carried out on the bulkheads of cargo tanks. There are many types including chloride, colour, chemical oxygen demand, methanol, non-volatile matter, permanganate time and water miscibility tests. Procedures should include the use of protective equipment where required.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Cargoes which are sensitive to contaminants such as salt and hydrocarbons can only be loaded if the tank is completely free of such contaminants.

 A wall wash test is a method to get a tank passed for loading such sensitive cargoes. Proper procedures and use of the correct equipment and reagents must be used and is detailed in the SMS

Failure of a wall wash test results in the failure of a tank and subsequent off hire, loss of earnings and the loss of Company’s reputation.

    <Question>Is the cargo sample locker situated within the main cargo area and is it in good order?</Question>
    <Guidance>Samples which have to be kept on board shall be stowed in a designated space situated in the cargo area, or, exceptionally, elsewhere, subject to the approval of the Administration.(IBC 16.5.1)
Note: If the locker contains flammable liquids, the SOLAS fire extinguishing arrangements are required.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Cargo sample from every tank loaded on the vessel is stored in the sample locker. Although it is in small quantities, the sample carries the same risks as the original cargo itself.
All samples are stored in one location and hence great care must be taken to ensure that the bottles are properly sealed and secured against falling or mixing with other samples. 

The dedicated sample locker is situated on the main deck away from accommodation to minimize exposure due to loss of containment of any sample
TIPS: - Samples are also very important to defend a cargo claim and as such the custody of the sample must be secure and monitored.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Is the cargo sample locker suitably constructed to prevent breakages?</Question>
    <Guidance>The stowage space shall be:
.1 Cell divided in order to avoid shifting of the bottles at sea;
.2 Made of material fully resistant to the different liquids intended to be stowed; and
.3 Equipped with adequate ventilation arrangements. (IBC 16.5.2)
Samples which react with each other dangerously shall not be stowed close to each other. (IBC 16.5.3)
Samples shall not be retained on board longer than necessary. (IBC 16.5.4)</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>In order to prevent breakages, sample lockers are usually constructed with cell guides so that each sample bottle can shift in a seaway. 

The cell guides must be of a material which will not be affected by any of the cargo samples. They are usually made of stainless steel. 

Cargo Samples must be stored keeping in mind their compatibility with others in the locker and the possibility of the sample being of a flammable nature in which case an adequate firefighting arrangement should be available.
TIPS: - Compatibility chart must be keep in the sample locker.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Are the cargo, ballast and stripping pumps, eductors and their associated instrumentation and controls , in good order and is there recorded evidence of regular testing?</Question>
    <Guidance />
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Cargo and Ballast systems on board a vessel have instrumentation which indicate the status of the operation and is relied upon by the officers and ratings who are associated with this operation. 

If such instrumentation is not working or shows wrong readings it can lead to loss of containment, pollution and even personal injury and death.

Instrumentation concerning these important operations of ballasting and cargo are regularly serviced by shore technicians and routinely calibrated on board by the ship staff using standard reference gauges. 

Record of such calibration and findings must be kept in order to monitor the variation from the accuracy required.

    <Question>Are the cargo system ullage gauges, vapour locks and UTI tapes in good order and are there recorded evidence of regular testing?</Question>
    <Guidance />
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Ullage gauges and UTI tapes should show accurate readings because the quantity of cargo is dependent on these readings.

 Any loss of containment due to overflow will cause pollution or exposure to toxic and hazardous substances. 

Difference in quantity between ship and shore is also a result of inaccuracy in the ship’s gauges. 
In a completely closed cargo operation, without the use of vapor locks, no other back up is possible if the fixed ullage system fails. 

It is therefore important to ensure that vapor locks are in working order.

    <Guidance />
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Tanks are fitted with temperature gauges locally at the tank as well as remotely displayed in the CCR. 
The correct temperature is necessary to calculate the quantity of cargo and also to monitor that the temperature of the cargo does not exceed or fall below any limitations given. 
Any such variation of temperature could be harmful (such as solidifying) to the product or even dangerous in case of some cargoes. 
Pressure related accidents (both low and high pressure) are very common on board tankers and great care must be taken to ensure that correct pressures are maintained throughout the cargo or ballast operations.
Standard temperature and pressure gauges must be calibrated annually so that the accuracy of the gauge is verified. 

Also prior to and during cargo and ballast operations regular checking of pressure gauges must be done to ensure that they are working . 

All ships are provided with portable pressure gauges which can be fitted on the vapor lock and used to compare the pressure with the fixed gauge.

    <Question>Are the cargo tank high level and overflow alarms in good order and is there recorded evidence of regular testing?</Question>
    <Guidance>Record if high level alarms are not fitted and also if the overfill alarm system is not independent of the main gauging system.
Cargo tanks shall be fitted with a visual and audible high-level alarm which indicates when the liquid level in the cargo tank approaches the normal full condition. (IBC 15.19.6)
The high level alarm system shall be independent of the overflow-control system and shall be independent of the gauging devices (These are listed in IBC 13.1). (IBC 15.19.5)
A tank overflow control system shall:
.1 come into operation when the normal tank loading procedures fail to stop the liquid level exceeding the normal full condition;
.2 give a visual and audible tank-overflow alarm to the ship’s operator; and
.3 provide an agreed signal for sequential shutdown of onshore pumps or valves or both and of the ship’s valves. The signal, as well as the pump and valve shutdown, may be dependent on operator’s intervention. The use of shipboard automatic closing valves shall be permitted only when specific approval has been obtained from the Administration and the port State authority concerned. (IBC 15.19.7)
Note: High level alarms should be in operation during both loading and discharging operations.</Guidance>

    <Question>Are cargo line drains suitably positioned to preclude liquid remaining in the line after draining?</Question>
    <Guidance />
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Usually a ship’s design makes sure that the drains in a cargo line are in a position where all cargo in that line is expected to collect and can be emptied by draining.

 When a cargo line is being cleaned and emptied you must make sure that the drain is effective in doing so and there can be no other cargo left in this line.
As part of any operation which is adopted by individual ships or persons for the cleaning of lines, the following procedures are to be incorporated as a matter of MTMSM POLICY.
	
1. Make a plan.
2. Inform all concerned parties in the operation.  Agree services required are available.
3. Examine all interconnecting lines and pumps.
4. Lines are to be carried from the tanks, through the pumps to the manifold.
5. Clean optional lines through the pump.
6a. Use salt water/fresh water/steam/air/chemicals as required.
6b. Use caution when washing stainless steel tanks or cargo lines with seawater.
7. Flush with fresh water and drain the line.
8. Open all line outlets.
9. Examine line – Pump drainings for traces of contaminant.
10. Blow and vent the line until completely dry.
11. Charge the line with product which is to be discharged.
12. Examine the quality of the product in the line.
13. If the product is seen to be contaminated, recirculate it through the pump and line system and flush it to the slop tank.
14. Open all line and pump outlets again and blow and vent the line.
15. If contamination is still present, repeat the line cleaning operation. It is probably due to ‘pick up’ from an isolated pocket.
13. If the product is seen to be contaminated, recirculate it through the pump and line system and flush it to the slop tank.
14. Open all line and pump outlets again and blow and vent the line.
15. If contamination is still present, repeat the line cleaning operation. It is probably due to ‘pick up’ from an isolated pocket.

    <Question>Are there records of the calibration of key cargo instrumentation, including temperature and pressure gauges?</Question>
    <Guidance>Notes: There should be records of the regular checking and calibration of instrumentation, particularly cargo tank temperature and pressure gauges. Calibration should be carried out preferably at intervals not exceeding 30 months.

Calibration of instrumentation is often difficult whilst the vessel is in service and it is usually carried out during repair periods. However, comparisons between local and remote thermometer readings provide a practical cross-reference.</Guidance>

    <OfficeRemarks>Tanks are fitted with temperature gauges locally at the tank as well as remotely displayed in the CCR. 
The correct temperature is necessary to calculate the quantity of cargo and also to monitor that the temperature of the cargo does not exceed or fall below any limitations given. 
Any such variation of temperature could be harmful (such as solidifying) to the product or even dangerous in case of some cargoes. 
Pressure related accidents (both low and high pressure) are very common on board tankers and great care must be taken to ensure that correct pressures are maintained throughout the cargo or ballast operations.

    <OfficeRemarks>On Chemical tankers less than 20,000 deadweight, Inert Gas is not a requirement. However some vessels are fitted with Nitrogen generators or Inert Gas generators.
If these are fitted, the complete system of Inert gas generation including the pipeline and fittings must be part of the PMS and regularly checked that it generates the oxygen deficient air that it is designed for. 

YOU MUST NOTE THAT SUCH N2 or IG Generator may not be frequently used on Chemical tankers so it is even more important that the performance of such equipment is regularly checked.

    <OfficeRemarks>Some cargoes carried on a chemical tanker require cargo heating which is done through fixed steam heating coils inside a tank or where cargoes are sensitive to water, by means of a deck thermal heater. In case of a leak in the fixed heating coils inside a tank steam and / or water will leak and mix with the cargo.Especially when carrying cargo which requires constant temperature to be maintained, the working of the heating system must be thoroughly checked prior to loading. 

Test record must logged in the deck log book.

    <Question>If fixed tank gauges are not fitted, are sufficient portable tapes provided to simultaneously gauge each tank being worked?</Question>
    <Guidance>If a fixed cargo tank gauging system is fitted but is unreliable and portable tapes/vapour locks are being used as the main method of ullaging, this fact should be recorded as an Observation. The number of tapes in use must be recorded.
Notes: Portable tapes should be calibrated in accordance with manufacturer’s recommendations and valid certificates of calibration should be provided for each instrument. UTI tapes constitute “restricted” gauging and must not be used with cargoes that require “closed” operations as required by IBC chapter 17 column “j”.
There should also be two spare tapes on board.</Guidance>

    <Question>Is the vessel capable of operating in a closed condition if volatile or toxic products are handled, including ullaging and sampling?</Question>
    <Guidance>Open and restricted gauging shall be allowed only where:
.1 open venting is allowed by the Code; or
.2 means are provided for relieving tank pressure before the gauge is operated. (IBC 13.1.3) 
All tankers fitted with a fixed inert gas system shall be provided with a closed ullage system.
(SOLAS 1974 II-2/60.7 and SOLAS 2004 II-2/4.5.5.3.3))
Notes: On a chemical tanker, “closed” loading is required at all times when so specified in IBC chapter 17 column “j”. In such cases, use of portable UTI tapes is only permitted when these tapes are certified to be used in cases of complete gas-tight conditions. Use of gauges that are certificated for use in restricted operations is not permitted.
A volatile product is petroleum having a flash point below 600C as determined by the closed cup method of testing.
If a cargo is being handled at a temperature within 100C of its flashpoint, it should be considered volatile.
Therefore a cargo with a flashpoint of 800C should be considered volatile if handled at a temperature of 700C or above.</Guidance>

    <OfficeRemarks>All cargo operations must be carried out in a closed method except where allowed by column “j” in the IBC Code Chapter 17. On vessels fitted with Inert gas system, cargo operations are always carried out in a closed method. 
For closed method even the ullaging and sampling must be done without opening any ports. In such cases, if a portable UTI is used, it must be certified for use in any gas tight conditions. Closed type cargo operation is required when the release of any cargo vapor is prohibited due to being hazardous or toxic, thereby being harmful to people handling same.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Is the cargo venting system in good order?</Question>
    <Guidance>Note: The condition of p/v valves, mast risers, vent stacks, vapour lines, vacuum valves and flame screens should be assessed.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>When cargo is loaded into a tank, it displaces the mixture of air (or inert gas) and cargo vapor from the empty tank. This is released into the atmosphere through the P/V Valve. 

If the atmosphere in the tank cannot be released and the cargo loading continues, it is possible to over pressurize the tank and blow it up.

It is therefore important that the P/V Valve of a tank is in perfect working order so that pressure inside a tank is released at the designed pressure set on the Pressure side of the P/V valve.
Similarly when discharging cargo, the inert gas or air replaces the volume of cargo discharged, thereby not allowing the cargo tank to be subjected to a vacuum. 

For this the Vacuum side of the P/V Valve must open at it’s designed vacuum and allow air to enter the tank.  If the vessel is operating with Inert gas then Inert Gas will replace the volume of discharged cargo and the activation of vacuum or pressure side of the P/V Valve should not be necessary.
On a P/V valve, besides pressure release and allowing of air in a vacuum, it is also important to ensure that the Flame Screen on the vacuum side is not damaged and the mesh is clean so that the air passes through as designed. The flame screen is designed to keep out any ignition source such as flame from entering the tank when sucking in air. 

VENTING SYSTEM ON A TANKER CAN CAUSE TANK BURSTING DUE TO OVERPRESSURE OR COLLAPSE DUE TO HIGH VACUUM.
Manually check the P/V Valves before loading and discharging operation.

P/V Valves frame screen check six monthly as per  form D.118

    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>For vessels that are not using inert gas during cargo operations, the venting MUST be carried out only through the P/V Valve. Any extra pressure must be released through the P/V Valve and not by opening any ports on the tank which will release vapor at the deck level which can cause personal injury and even death.
P/V Valve settings fixed by the Yard and MUST NOT BE ALTERED. They must only be verified that the P/V Valve is operating at the set pressure and vacuum during actual loading and discharge of cargo. THIS IS DONE BY CHECKING THE LOCAL PRESSURE GAUGE AT THE TANK AND PHYSICALLY SEEING IF THE P/V VALVE OPERATES.

    <Question>Are SOLAS secondary venting requirements being complied with?</Question>
    <Guidance>Notes: Class societies may accept a system that may not comply with the SOLAS requirements for ‘Secondary means of full flow relief’.
In such cases the question should be answered ‘No’. A full description of the system as fitted should be made as an Observation to allow an assessment of acceptability to be made.
Controlled tank venting systems shall consist of a primary and a secondary means of allowing full flow relief of vapour to prevent over-pressure or under-pressure in the event of failure of one means. Alternatively, the secondary means may consist of pressure sensors fitted in each tank with a monitoring system in the  ship’s cargo control room or position from which cargo operations are normally carried out. Such monitoring equipment shall also provide an alarm facility which is activated by detection of over-pressure or under-pressure conditions within a tank. (IBC 8.3.3)
Vessels equipped with vapour collection systems must be fitted with a pressure sensing device that senses the pressure in the main vapour collection line, which:
(a) Has a pressure indicator located on the vessel where the cargo transfer is controlled; and
(b) Has a high pressure and a low pressure alarm that:
(1) Is audible and visible on the vessel where cargo transfer is controlled;
(2) Alarms at a high pressure of not more than 90 percent of the lowest pressure relief valve setting in the cargo tank venting system; and
(3) Alarms at a low pressure of not less than four inches water gauge (0.144 psig) for an inerted tankship, or the lowest vacuum relief valve setting in the cargo tank venting system for a non-inerted tankship. (CFR 46 39.20-13)
Notes: In the case of inerted vessels, if pressure sensors are provided as the means of secondary protection, the alarm settings for the pressure sensors must be set to actuate when the tank pressure reaches 10% greater than the normal actuation settings of the pressure valves themselves. In the case of the low-pressure settings, the pressure in a tank should never be permitted to fall below zero and the pressure sensors should be set to alarm above zero.
In the case of non-inerted vessels if pressure sensors are provided, the over-pressure setting should be set to alarm at 10% greater than the normal actuation settings of the pressure valves, and at a vacuum 10% greater than the normal actuation settings of the vacuum valves.
In all cases, a description of the secondary venting arrangements should be provided, in particular what vents or pressure/vacuum sensing systems are available on each tank when the main inlet valve to IG/vent main is shut. Where electronic pressure/vacuum sensors are provided, identify and record whether the alarms are set to operate at the correct value or some other value. Where two full flow PV valves are fitted on a tank it is recommended that each PV valve has its own deck penetration. </Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Over pressure or under pressure in tank is extremely dangerous and can cause a tank structure to explode or deform due to vacuum.

 It is therefore extremely important that at no time during any cargo or ballast operation the tank must be subject to either over pressure or under pressure.
 A secondary venting method can either be another set of P/V valves or other means of venting if the original P/V valve fails OR it can be only an independent set of audio and visual alarms from pressure and vacuum sensors provided for each tank.

 BOTH ARE METHODS TO COMPLY WITH SECONDARY VENTING.

Immediately upon joining a vessel, as part of the familiarization YOU MUST LEARN THE SYSTEM OF SECONDARY VENTING ON BOARD YOUR VESSEL so that you are 100% sure how it works and will be able to immediately identify if it is not functional.

Failure of SECONDARY VENTING IS A NON COMPLIANCE WITH SOLAS REQUIREMENTS and a detainable deficiency.
SECONDARY VENTING SYSTEM DURING ANY CARGO OR BALLAST OPERATION SHOULD NEVER BE UNDER AN ALARM CONDITION. 

In such a case, you must immediately stop all operations and continue ONLY AFTER THE FAULT HAS BEEN RECTIFIED.

NON - INERTED VESSELS 
 
over-pressure setting should be set to alarm at 10% greater than the normal actuation settings of the pressure valves, and at a vacuum 10% greater than the normal actuation settings of the vacuum valves.

INERTED VESSELS USING INERT GAS 

the pressure sensors must be set to actuate when the tank pressure reaches 10% greater than the normal actuation settings of the pressure valves. 
 
low-pressure settings, the pressure in a tank should never be permitted to fall below zero and the pressure sensors should be set to alarm above zero.

    <Question>Are the P/V valves in good order, inspected and cleaned as part of a regular planned maintenance routine and are there records to support this?</Question>
    <Guidance>Notes: High jet cones and flaps should not be jacked open, particularly when loading.
Verify that p/v valves, where fitted, are tight and in good order.
High jet vents are not fitted with flame screens and their correct operation relies on a pressure build-up within the compartment which opens the valve at a predetermined level and results in a gas exit velocity of a minimum of 30 metres/sec. This results in protection against the passage of flame, the speed of which is about 7.5 metres/sec.
Consistent with safety and without interfering with operations and if appropriate to the design of the venting equipment, request the manual lifting of p/v valves to demonstrate satisfactory operation. P/v valves should be checked for free movement prior to the commencement of each cargo operation as required by the Ship to Shore Safety Check List question 31.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>P/V valves for the first line of defense in Venting. They are designed to release pressure and allow air to enter in case the tank is over or under pressure. 

Any obstruction in this venting arrangement can allow the tank to be over or under pressurized and cause extensive damage to the tank.

The SSCL requires verification prior to every cargo operation that the P/V has been checks and found to be in working order.

SUCH RESPONSIBILITY MUST NOT BE LEFT ONLY TO THE CREW AND MUST BE CROSS CHECKED BY A RESPONSIBLE OFFICER.

Manually check the P/V Valves before loading and discharging operation.

    <Question>If the vessel is operating with a vapour return line connected, are appropriate transfer procedures in place?</Question>
    <Guidance>Vessels equipped with vapour collection systems must be fitted with a pressure sensing device that senses the pressure in the main vapour collection line, which:
(a) Has a pressure indicator located on the vessel where the cargo transfer is controlled; and
(b) Has a high pressure and a low pressure alarm that:
(1) Is audible and visible on the vessel where cargo transfer is controlled;
(2) Alarms at a high pressure of not more than 90 percent of the lowest pressure relief valve setting in the cargo tank venting system; and
(3) Alarms at a low pressure of not less than four inches water gauge (0.144 psig) for an inerted tankship, or the lowest vacuum relief valve setting in the cargo tank venting system for anon-inerted tankship. (CFR 46 39.20-13)
Note: Particular attention should be paid to monitoring the pressure in the cargo tanks and the associated line system. P/v valves, the ullaging system and the level alarms should have been thoroughly tested prior to the transfer commencing and there should be awareness of the initial transfer rate and maximum allowable transfer rates.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>When cargo is loaded in a tank, it displaces the vapor inside the tank. If such vapor is not allowed to be dispersed into the atmosphere through the normal ship’s venting system, then a vapor return system is used where no vapor is released into the air and is either sent ashore or circulated back to the ship. 

For such vapor return operations there are strict requirements and precautions to be taken.
If during your cargo operation planning you find that the chemical being loaded requires the vapor return line to be used, THEN PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT IT IS USED IN THE LOAD PORT WITHOUT FAIL. ARRANGEMENTS FOR CONNECTION OF THE VAPOR RETURN LINE SHOULD BE MADE BEFORE ARRIVING AT THE LOAD BERTH.

Alarm setting point as following:( As per CFR 46 39.20-13 )
 
Alarms at a high pressure of not more than 90 percent of the lowest pressure relief valve setting in the cargo tank venting system.

Alarms at a low pressure of not less than four inches water gauge (0.144 psig, 0.99Kpa) for an inerted tank ship,
or the lowest vacuum relief valve setting in the cargo tank venting system for a non-inerted tank ship.

    <Question>Where vapour locks are fitted to cargo tanks that are not fitted with full depth sounding pipes, are static electricity precautions taken to ensure that the appropriate relaxation period elapses prior to ullaging or sampling?</Question>
    <Guidance>Operations carried out through sounding pipes are permissible at any time because it is not possible for any significant charge to accumulate on the surface of the liquid within a correctly designed and installed sounding pipe. A sounding pipe is defined as a conducting pipe which extends the full depth of the tank and which is effectively bonded and earthed to the tank structure at its extremities. The pipe should be slotted in order to prevent any pressure differential between the inside of the pipe and the tank and to ensure that true level indications are obtained       (ISGOTT 11.8.2.3)</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>If the vessel is fitted with a full depth sounding pipe, then it is considered as an electric conductor and settling time of 30 minutes is not necessary for each tank prior to manual dipping, sampling or ullaging.

    <Question>Are metal tapes and other gauging or sampling devices effectively bonded before being introduced into tanks?</Question>
    <Guidance>Note: UTI tapes must be bonded before being introduced into tanks. UTI tapes which have quick couplings to connect the unit to the vapour lock will possibly not require bonding wires. However, the internal bonding of such units should be checked every six months in accordance with the manufacturer’s requirements.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>When using metallic equipment for dipping, ullaging or sampling, there is a possibility of a brush discharge between the equipment and the charged liquid surface as the two approach each other.
Any such metallic equipment should therefore be properly earthed.

    <Question>If portable tank cleaning hoses are used, are continuity tests carried out and the results recorded?</Question>
    <Guidance>Bonding wires should be incorporated within all portable tank washing hoses to ensure electrical continuity. Couplings should be connected to the hose in such a way that effective bonding is ensured between them. Hoses should be indelibly marked to allow identification. A record should be kept showing the date and the result of electrical continuity testing. (ISGOTT 11.3.6.2)
All hoses supplied for tank washing machines should be tested for electrical continuity in a dry condition prior to use, and in no case should the resistance exceed 6 ohms per metre length. (ISGOTT 11.3.6.3)</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Portable tank cleaning hoses carry the same risks as metallic gauging and must be bonded prior to use.

Although these hoses wil be used after completion of the cargo, YOU MUST FOLLOW ALL PRECAUTIONS FOR STATIC ACCUMULATOR CARGOES TO PREVENT STATIC ELECTRICITY BEING DISCHARGED IN THE TANK WHICH MAY HAVE FLAMMABLE ATMOSPHERE.
Portable tank cleaning hoses MUST be checked for continuity by the Chief Officer BEFORE EVERY USE and should not exceed 6 OHMS per meter of the hose. If it is more than 6 OHMS, this hose MUST NOT BE USED TILL THE CONTINUITY IS IMPROVED.

    <Guidance>Manifold pressure gauges should be fitted to the spool pieces/reducers on the outboard side of the manifold valves. (ISGOTT 24.6.3)</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Pressure gauges fitted on the outboard of the manifold valves are essential to;
Indicate whether the manifold valve is leaking when shut;
To indicate the pressure in the shore cargo hose during loading.
To indicate the back pressure on the manifold during discharge. This is needed to demonstrate the compliance with Charter Parties for maintaining minimum pressure during discharge.
Pressure gauges when fitted, must be in good working order showing reliable readings. 

Unreliable pressure gauges pose the same or greater risk as one not fitted. 

Many times a pressure gauge is fitted and in working order but not functional as the valve was not opened.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Are manifold blank flanges of an equivalent rating to that of the manifold pipelines?</Question>
    <Guidance>Notes: It is generally accepted that steel blanks should be of the same thickness as the flanges to which they are attached, but this will not necessarily result in the pressure capability being the same as that of the associated pipework.
It is the pressure rating of the blank which is important and blanks made of materials such as titanium have a superior strength and may therefore be significantly thinner for the same pressure rating as a mild steel blank. If such a blank is fitted, there must be documentation on board to prove that the pressure rating is adequate for the service.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>The manifold blank flanges are tested to the same pressure as the pipelines. 

As such they must be of the same pressure rating as the pipelines.
Since documentation is needed to prove that the blank flanges are of the same strength as the pipeline, you must record that during the pressure test of the pipelines the blank flanges were also tested by fitting them in their relevant positions.

    <Guidance />
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Especially on a chemical tanker, there are several manifold connections as each tank has it’s own manifold connection. 

It is therefore very easy for connecting a wrong cargo hose from shore to the vessel. 

This can be disastrous due to incompatibility or overflow or burst hose in case the tank at the end of the connection is not lined up.
In any case, the correct cargo product MUST be connected to the correct line up on the ship and this should be clearly marked on the manifold by a sign board with the product name and the tank # to which the product is going.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>On vessels with pump rooms, are they free of evidence of significant leaks from machinery, pipework, valve glands and instrumentation?

Are bulkhead seals gas tight and, if required, well lubricated?</Question>
    <Guidance />
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Chemical tankers are normally fitted with deep well pumps and will not have a cargo pump room.

They will however have a ballast pump room. In case of a ballast pump room water leakage can also make the space inaccessible due to excessive flooding.
Oil leakage from the ballast pumps, gauges or the Marpol Annex I overboard line passing through the ballast pump room, can cause the atmosphere to be contaminated and hazardous for man entry.
Chief Officer make sure that pump room  is free of evidence of significant leaks from machinery, pipework, valve glands and instrumentation.

    <Guidance>All tankers shall be fitted, by the date of the first scheduled docking after 1st July 2002 but not later than 1st July 2005, with a system for continuous monitoring of the concentration of hydrocarbon gases. Sampling points or detector heads shall be located in suitable positions in order that potentially dangerous leakages are readily detected. When the hydrocarbon gas concentration reaches a pre-set level, which shall not be higher than 10% of the LEL, a continuous audible and visual alarm signal shall be automatically effected in the in the pump room and cargo control room to alert personnel to the potential hazard. (SOLAS 2000 II-2/4.5.10.1.3 and 1.6.7)
The alarm shall be automatically affected in the pump room, engine control room, cargo control room and navigation bridge on vessels constructed on or after 1st July 2002. (SOLAS 2000 II-2/4.5.10.1.3)
Note: Existing systems having a pre-set level of not more than 30% LEL may be accepted on vessels constructed before 1st July 2002</Guidance>

    <Guidance>Notes: Cargo lifting equipment should be load tested every five years and thoroughly examined by a competent person annually. Other lifting equipment is not regulated except as usually required by class, but should be tested and examined under a similar regime. The minimum SWL for which testing is required is one tonne (1,000 kgs).
A Chain Register is not required, but documentation supporting testing, examination and maintenance that follows the OCIMF Publication Recommendations for the Tagging/Labeling, Testing and Maintenance, Documentation/Certification for Ships' Lifting Equipment should be maintained.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Maintenance of crane and other cargo related lifting gear is  very important to ensure that there are no delays due to their failure  during cargo operation. 

 Failure of such equipment can result in delays in cargo operations.

 Additionally sudden failure of cargo gear can result in personal injury and accident.
Most vessels are provided with a chain register which is endorsed by Class Annually. 

In addition, all vessels must follow the OCIMF guidelines for Marking, Labeling and Testing.  Masters must ensure that the chain register is stamped by class surveyor before the expiry of last annual. 
 
Additionally load test is to be carried out once every 5 years. Load test is always conducted in presence of a class surveyor.

    <OfficeRemarks>Maintenance of crane and other cargo related lifting gear is very important to ensure that there are no delays due to their failure during cargo operation. 

 Failure of such equipment can result in delays in cargo operations. 

Additionally sudden failure of cargo gear can result in personal injury and accident.
All our vessels are fitted with cranes and thus do not have winches for lifting but are hydraulically operated. 

It is of utmost important to follow proper PMS in order to prevent any breakdowns. 

 Any hydraulic  Oil leakage  from the crane is a pollution hazard and even a small leak of hydraulic  oil accompanied  by rain can make the situation unmanageable and lead to pollution.</OfficeRemarks>

    <QuestionNo>9.2</QuestionNo>
    <Question>Do all mooring ropes and where fitted, mooring wire tails, meet OCIMF guidelines?</Question>
    <Guidance>Mooring lines should preferably all be of the same material and construction. Ropes with low elastic elongation properties are recommended for larger tankers as they limit the tanker’s movement at the berth. High modulus synthetic fibre ropes are a viable replacement for winch-stowed steel wire ropes for the mooring of large tankers at terminals, other than single point moorings. Recommendations on their use are contained in the OCIMF publication ‘Guidelines on the Use of High Modulus Synthetic Fibre Ropes as Mooring Lines on Large Tankers’. (ISGOTT 23.4.1)
Where dynamic (shock) loading on moorings can be caused by swell conditions or the close passing of ships, fibre tails on the ends of mooring wires and high modulus synthetic fibre mooring ropes can provide sufficient elasticity to prevent failure of the mooring and other components in the mooring system. The tanker or the terminal may provide the tails, whose length should not exceed one third of the distance between the ship’s fairlead and the shore mooring bollard. (ISGOTT 23.4.1)
Any material having moderate to high elasticity is suitable for the manufacture of tails. Common materials include polyester, polyester/polyolefin composites and polyamide. To increase fatigue life and strength, it is recommended that tails are torque matched to the main line. Synthetic tails should have an MBL at least 25% higher than that of the mooring line to which they are attached. Polyamide tails should have a 37% higher MBL than the mooring line to take account of loss of strength when wet. (MEG 6.5.1)
Polyamide is previously referred to as Nylon and it loses 10-15% of its strength when wet. It has the highest elasticity of regularly used materials with good temperature and abrasion resistance (MEG 6.3.1.2)
The traditional tail length of 11 metres is adequate for sheltered pierside moorings where little or no wave induced vessel motion occur. At exposed pierside moorings where significant ship motions occur, the tail length of 11 metres may be inadequate. This could lead to immediate tensile failure or, in the longer term, lead to the fatigue failure of main winch ropes and/or mooring equipment onboard or ashore. Longer tail lengths may be required for exposed berths where waves up to 2 metres significant wave height and having periods in excess of 10 seconds may be encountered. Increased tail length will typically only be required for breast lines and may not be necessary for spring lines. (MEG 6.5.2)
Tails should be replaced at least every 18 months unless experience and hours in use coupled with inspection indicates a longer or shorter period is warranted. A record of service should be maintained that includes time in use and inspection results. Tails should be replaced prior to their residual strength falling to 60% of their original MBL. (MEG 6.5.3)
Notes: The 18 month period mentioned above is based upon the actual time in use on an average ship in average trade. The important factor is that an inspection/assessment programme is in place (with records). The use of primarily polyester blends as opposed to nylon should be acceptable, based on existing OCIMF guidance on the fibre properties.</Guidance>

The ships should also hold a certificate attesting to the strength of the bow chain stopper(s) foundations and associated ship supporting structure substantiated by detailed engineering analysis or calculation. 
Bow chain stoppers, associated foundation and supporting structure should be subject to periodic survey, at least once every 5 years, and maintained in good order.

    <Question>Is there a policy in place for the testing of winch brakes and are the results recorded?</Question>
    <Guidance>The primary brake should be set to hold 60% of the mooring line’s minimum breaking load. Since brakes may deteriorate in service, it is recommended that new equipment be designed to hold 80% of the line’s minimum breaking load, but have the capability to be adjusted down to 60%.(MEG 7.4.6)
Regardless of the brake type, periodic testing is essential to ensure safe mooring (MEG 7.4.5)
The main purpose of brake testing is to verify that the brake will render at a load less than the design rope’s MBL. New ships are normally supplied with a brake test kit of the simplified type. Each winch manufacturer will have their own test equipment and procedures which should be followed by the operator. (MEG 7.4.5.1)
Each winch should be tested individually and test should be carried out prior to the ship’s delivery and then every year thereafter following recommendations in ISGOTT. In addition, individual winches should be tested after completion of any modification or repair involving the winch brakes, or upon any evidence of premature brake slippage or related malfunctions. Brakes should be tested to prove they render at a load that is equivalent to 60% of the line’s MBL (MEG 7.4.5.2)
It is recommended that a complete set of test equipment is placed on board each ship properly stowed in an appropriate location. Alternatively the owner may elect to procure one or two sets of testing equipment for each type and size of winch and retain this equipment in a convenient central location for shipment to repair facilities (MEG 7.4.5.5)
Ideally, a brake should hold and render within a very small range and once it renders, should shed only enough load to bring the line tension back to a safe level. Unfortunately, the widely used band brake with screw is only marginally satisfactory in fulfilling these requirements and its operation requires special care. (MEG 7.4)
Specifications should be available on the winch drum to show the design holding capacity and the torque required on the hand wheel or lever to achieve this. (MEG 1.8) 
Note: If mooring lines are utilised that have a minimum breaking load in excess of that for which the winch was originally designed, the brakes should be set to render at 60% of the minimum breaking load of the mooring line for which the winch was designed. A further consideration in such cases is that if the over- strength line is of a greater diameter than the mooring line for which the winch was designed, full stowage on the drum must be made and in the case of split-drum winches, must not result in excess layers on the tension part of the drum when in use.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>1. The brake testing should be carried out depending on weather the winch has split drum or not 
     Case 1 -- if no split drum , the brake should be tested on an assumption that there are 4 layers on the drum 
     case 2 -- If split drum, the testing should be done for the 1st layer 

2. the marking of the brake should be such that it cannot be moved by hand 

3. Brake testing kit should be kept in a location where all crew members are aware of its location and use 

4. If any maintenance is carried out on the winch brake then retesting should be carried out prior use</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Are moorings satisfactorily deployed and tended?</Question>
    <Guidance>Generally mooring lines of the same size and type (material) should be used for all leads. Mooring lines should be arranged so that all lines in the same service are about the same length between the ship and the shore bollard. (MEG 1.5)
Note: The mooring arrangement in use for the port and its effectiveness should be reviewed. Breastlines provide the bulk of transverse restraint, backsprings the longitudinal. Headlines and sternlines contribute much less to the mooring strength than is commonly supposed.</Guidance>

    <Question>Are mooring lines secured to bitts and turned up correctly?</Question>
    <Guidance>The recommended method of turning up a rope on bitts is to take one or two full turns around the leading post before figure of eighting. The reason for this is to reduce the tendency to pull the two posts together. However when turning up unjacketed high modulus lines around bitts, for example when a tug’s line fast, two turns should be taken around the leading post prior to turning the line up in a figure of eight fashion (MEG 8.2)

    <Question>Are all powered mooring lines correctly reeled on drums, secured on brakes and winches out of gear.</Question>
    <Guidance>A band brake is designed to work in one direction only, so the line must always be reeled correctly onto the drum. Each arrangement should be assessed on a case-by-case basis with reference to the manufacturer’s guidance. With lines correctly reeled, tension on the line should be in a direction that causes the free end of the band to be forced towards the fixed end, thereby forcing the two halves of the band together. (MEG 7.4.2.6)
Winches should never be left in gear with the mooring winch band brake on. Hydraulic or electric drives can suffer severe damage should the brake render. Mooring drums should always be left disconnected from the winch drive whenever the mooring line is tensioned and the band brake is fully applied. (MEG 7.4.2.3)</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>1. once the gear of the mooring winch is disconnected, please return the locking pin to its correct position 
2.  When using the winch make sure that the scupper plug of the drip tray is effectively plugged

    <Question>If mooring tails are fitted to wires, do they have proper connecting links and are they correctly fitted?</Question>
    <Guidance>Tails should be connected to a wire mooring line using appropriate shackles, for example, those manufactured by Mandal, Tonsberg and Boss. The SWL of the joining shackle should be equal to or greater than, the SWL of the mooring line to which it is attached. It is critical that the connecting links are rigged in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The eye of the tails should be protected with a suitable sheath, the use of leather sheathing is not recommended. If the manufacturer recommends that it is appropriate, a synthetic tail can be attached to a high modulus rope by using a cow hitch. The hitch provides a suitable method of joining ropes without the use of thimbles or other hardware. The cow hitch
will reduce the strength of the arrangement by approximately 15%. The use of cow hitches is not recommended for connecting mooring pendants to Aramid lines on account of compression damage.    (MEG 6.5.4)
Notes: Tonsberg have a straight pin and the tail should be connected to it; Mandal has a curved roller and the wire should be connected to it; Boss links can be connected in either direction. In all cases, it is critical that the connecting links are rigged in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>1. when using mooring tails with wires, please check the correct position of the mandal or tonrsberg shackle during mooring and after mooring operations. Some times due to extra weight the shackle can twist and tail and wire can switch positions causing a wrong direction of lead on the shackle. 

Example -- on a mandal shackle the wire must be on the roller. If it twists due to tension the wire can jump to the fixed end of the mandal shackle causing wrong rig.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>If mooring winches in a gas hazardous area are electrically powered, are motors Ex ‘d’ rated and have insulation tests carried out and results recorded.</Question>
    <Guidance>Notes: Most mooring winches will be outside gas hazardous areas and therefore will not require an ‘Ex’ rating. If not, there must be evidence available, either by a manufacturer’s plate on the motor, or by documentation, that the motor is rated for use in a gas-hazardous area. An Ex ‘d’ rating means that the equipment can withstand an internal explosion without igniting the outside atmosphere. Ex ‘e’ is an increased safety rating. Glands at the point of entry of electric cables into junction boxes should be checked. Records should be available of the testing of the insulation resistance, from the phases to earth, of motors. The resistance should be above 1 Megohm. Falling insulation resistance indicates deterioration.</Guidance>

    <Question>Is single point mooring (SPM) and associated equipment fitted to OCIMF recommendations?</Question>
    <Guidance>Existing ships delivered before 2009 likely to trade to SPM’s should be equipped with bow chain stoppers designed to accept 76 mm chafe chain:
Up to 150,000 tdw:     1 stopper     200 tonnes swl
150 to 350,000 tdw:   2 stoppers    200 tonnes swl
Over 350,000 tdw:     2 stoppers    250 tonnes swl
New ships delivered during or after 2009 likely to visit SPMs should be equipped with bow chain stoppers designed to accept 76mm chafe chain in accordance with the following table. Owners of ships under construction before 2009 are encouraged to consider fitting bow chain stoppers in accordance with the recommendations for new ships.
Up to 100,000 tdw:    1 stopper    200 tonnes swl
100 to 175,000 tdw:   1 stoppers   250 tonnes swl
Over 175,000 tdw:     2 stoppers   350 tonnes swl
Stoppers should be located between 2.7 and 3.7 metres inboard from the bow fairlead (regardless of the size of vessel) and due consideration should be given to the correct alignment of stoppers relative to the lead between bow fairlead, stopper, pedestal fairlead and winch drum or the warping drum of the winch. A bow fairlead should measure at least 600 by 450 mm and be placed on the centre line. If two fairleads are recommended these should be spaced 2 metres centre to centre apart, but in no case more than 3 metres.      (MEG Appendix E.2)</Guidance>

    <Question>If the vessel is equipped for mooring at single point moorings, does it meet the recommendations as applicable, contained in Mooring Equipment Guidelines (3rd Edition)?</Question>
    <Guidance>Existing ships delivered before 2009
Existing ships delivered before 2009, likely to visit SPMs, should be equipped to safely handle pick-up ropes taking into consideration safety and protection from risk of whiplash injury to mooring personnel. It is recognised that existing ship mooring arrangements will normally require the use of pedestal rollers to achieve the desired lead through the bow fairlead and bow chain stopper to the winch storage drum. It is essential that pedestal rollers(s) are correctly positioned, relative to the winch storage drum and the centre of the bow chain stopper, to enable a direct lead from the centre of the bow fairlead to the centre of the bow chain stopper while allowing the pick-up rope to be stowed evenly on the storage drum. There should be at least 3.0 metres distance between the bow chain stopper and the closest pedestal roller to
allow for the pick-up rope eye, connecting shackle, shipboard-end oblong plate and a number of chafe chain links.
Owners of existing ships and ships under construction before 2009 are encouraged to consider the practicality of adopting the recommendations for new ships.
New ships delivered during or after 2009
New ships delivered during or after 2009 likely to visit SPM’s. Wherever possible, it is recommended that winch storage drums used to recover the pick-up ropes are positioned in a direct straight lead with the bow fairlead and bow chain stopper and without the use of pedestal rollers. This relative positioning of the tanker SPM mooring equipment in a direct straight lead is considered the safest and most efficient arrangement for handling the pick-up ropes. However, recognising that not all new mooring arrangement designs will permit direct straight leads to a winch storage drum, consideration of safety and protection from risk of whiplash injury to mooring personnel should take priority in determining the number and
positioning of pedestal rollers. In addition to the pedestal roller arrangement recommendations for existing ships, the number of pedestal rollers used for each bow chain stopper should not exceed two and the angle of change of direction of the pick-up rope lead should be minimal.
Remote operated winch storage drums may afford some additional protection whiplash protection for the winch operator.
Winch storage drum used to stow the pick-up rope for existing and new ships should be capable of lifting at least 15 tonnes and be of sufficient size to accommodate 150 metres of 80 mm diameter rope. Use of winch drum ends (warping ends) to handle pick-up ropes is considered unsafe and should be avoided.      (MEG Appendix E.4)</Guidance>

    <Question>Are emergency towing arrangements readily available for deployment at both ends of the vessel?</Question>
    <Guidance>The requirement for emergency towing arrangements applies to oil, chemical and gas tankers over 20,000 tdw.
For tankers constructed before 1 July 2002:
• The design and construction of emergency towing arrangements shall be approved by the Administration, based on the guidelines developed by the Organisation (MSC.35);
• The aft emergency towing arrangement should be pre-rigged and capable of being deployed in a controlled manner in harbour conditions by one person within 15 minutes;
• The pick-up gear for the aft towing pennant should be designed at least for manual operation by one person taking into account the absence of power and the potential for adverse environmental conditions that may prevail during such emergency towing operations. The pick up gear should be protected against the weather and other adverse conditions that may prevail;
• The forward emergency towing arrangement should be capable of being deployed in harbor conditions in not more than one hour. (It is unlikely that a length of chain could be retrieved within the time limit if it is stored in the foc’s’le space);
• Forward emergency towing arrangements which comply with the requirements for aft emergency towing arrangements may be accepted;
• All emergency towing arrangements should be clearly marked to facilitate safe and effective use even in darkness and poor visibility;
• All emergency towing components should be inspected by ship personnel at regular intervals and maintained in good working order. (MSC.35)
For tankers constructed on or after 1st July 2002:
• The arrangements shall, at all times, be capable of rapid deployment in the absence of main power on the ship to be towed and easy connection to the towing ship. At least one of the emergency towing arrangements shall be pre-rigged ready for rapid deployment; and, 
• Emergency towing arrangements at both ends shall be of adequate strength taking into account the size and deadweight of the ship and the expected forces during bad weather conditions.   (SOLAS II-1/3-4,1.2)
Once the system has been deployed the watertight integrity of adjacent spaces should be maintained.
The prime emergency towing arrangement may be fitted either forward or aft.</Guidance>

    <Question>Is the satellite EPIRB fitted, armed and labelled correctly and inspected in accordance with the manufacturer’s requirements?</Question>
    <Guidance>The EPIRB shall be:
• capable of transmitting a distress alert through the polar orbiting satellite service operating in the 406 MHz band;''
• Installed in an easily accessible position;
• Ready to be manually released and capable of being carried by one person into a survival craft;
• Capable of floating free if the ship sinks and of being automatically activated when afloat; and
• Capable of being activated manually. (SOLAS IV/7.1.6)
Satellite EPIRBs shall be annually tested within 3 months before the expiry date, or 3 months before or after the anniversary date, of the Cargo Ship Safety Radio Certificate. The test may be conducted on board the ship or at an approved testing station; and subject to maintenance at intervals not exceeding five years, (SOLAS IV/15.9)
Notes: The vessel’s name, the serial number and the maritime mobile services identity (MMSI or 15 Hex ID) should be clearly indicated on the EPIRB.
The inspection of EPIRB’s should include:
• Inspection of the housing to ensure it is undamaged;
• Inspection of the hydrostatic release unit to ensure it is in good order and in date. Releases should be renewed after two years;
• Inspection of the lanyard, which should be neatly stowed and not attached to the ship;
• Ensuring that the markings remain clearly decipherable;
• Checking the battery to ensure it is in good order and in date. The battery life for most EPIRB’s is 5 years;
• Carrying out a self test. Most EPIRB’s have a self test facility which is usually a spring-loaded switch.
When activated a light will indicate that the test circuits are operating correctly and sometimes this will also activate the strobe light. It is recommended that the self test switch be held for no more than 2 flashes of the strobe light, or no longer than 1 minute after the first self-test mode burst transmission.
When the self-test is activated on a 406 MHz EPIRB, the EPIRB is allowed to radiate a single burst which is specially coded so that it is ignored by the COSPAS-SARSAT system. The EPIRB must never be tested by actual operation.
The annual testing of 406 MHz satellite EPIRB’s required by SOLAS IV/15.9 requires test equipment capable of performing all the relevant measurements detailed in MSC/Circ 1040.</Guidance>

    <Question>Are detailed bunker transfer instructions available?</Question>
    <Guidance>Notes: All bunkering operations should be carefully planned and executed. Pollution caused when heavy fuel oil is spilt is particularly damaging and difficult to clean up.
Personnel involved in the bunkering operation onboard should have no other tasks and should remain at their workstations during topping off. This is particularly important when bunkers are being loaded concurrent with cargo operations, so that conflicts of interest for operational personnel are avoided.
Planning of bunkering operations should include the following:
• Determining that there is adequate space for the volume of bunkers to be loaded;
• Specific procedures for storage and separation of different grades/sulphur content of bunkers.
• The maximum filling volume;
• Controls for the setting of bunker system valves;
• Determining loading rates for the start of loading, bulk loading and topping off;
• Arrangements of bunker tank ventilation;
• Internal tank overflow arrangements;
• Verification of gauging system operation and accuracy;
• Alarm settings on overfill alarm units;
• Communication with the terminal to establish when bunkering can be undertaken;
• Methods of managing the handling of bunkers which have or may have a H2S or benzene content and testing procedures for determining the presence of hydrocarbon or H2S or benzene vapours;
• Method of determining the temperature of the bunkers during loading;
• Communications procedure for the operation, including emergency stop;
• Changing over tanks during loading;
• Containment arrangements and cleanup equipment to be available;
• Manning requirement to execute the operation safely.
Ship’s personnel should always be alert to the possible presence of H2S or benzene in bunker fuel.
It is preferable that a diagram of the fuel oil transfer piping be attached to the plan.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>In addition to above guidance,the bunker checklist should be available for all fuel and lubes (in bulk) bunkered. The checklist has to be completed with the same details as the `ship shore safety checklist`.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Is the vessel able to safely comply with SECA/ECA legislation or other local requirements regarding use of low sulphur fuels in boilers?</Question>
    <Guidance>Notes: Use of low sulphur distillate fuels presents a safety risk in boilers that have not been specifically designed or modified for such use and inspectors must establish that the boilers are certificated to be able to safely burn these bunkers or that an alternative method of heating is utilised that does not require operation of the boiler in port. The OCIMF/INTERTANKO information paper "Recommendations on the Hazard Assessment of Fuel Changeover Processes" provides further guidance. If the vessel is not trading in areas where low sulphur is required, the question is to be answered 'NA'.</Guidance>

    <Question>Is a planned maintenance system being followed and is it up to date?</Question>
    <Guidance>Notes: Although there is no specific requirement for any particular computer or paper-based planned maintenance system (PMS) to be provided, the Company should establish procedures to ensure that the ship is maintained in conformity with the provisions of the relevant Regulations and with any additional requirements which may be established by the Company and specified in the ISM Code Section 10.1. Inspectors must ascertain that a PMS is in place and that it is accurate, up to date, effective and maintained in accordance with the requirements of the ISM Code, the Operator's procedures and of the
best practices set out in Tanker Management Self Assessment (TMSA) Element 4. Responsible personnel 
should be able to demonstrate familiarity with the system.
The planned maintenance programme should include:
• Details of maintenance schedules whether carried out according to running hours or calendar period, or if condition monitoring is used as a substitute;
• Details, referenced to equipment manufacturer’s instructions or experience, of what maintenance is required;
• Historical data on maintenance and repair work which has been carried out;
• Spare parts inventory;
• Any proposed major repairs or overhauls should have a completion schedule, with spare parts verified as being on board or on order.
Inspectors must take into account the Class Machinery Survey notation under which the vessel is operated and of the planned maintenance system associated with the notation. Planned maintenance may be conducted under various different Class survey schemes; however, not all of these require Class approval. 
These schemes are:
Machinery Renewal or Engine Survey (ES) Class approval of the PMS is not required.
Planned Maintenance Scheme (PMS) A “Certificate of Approval for Planned Maintenance Scheme” is required.
Continuous Survey Machinery (CSM) Vessel is approved for Continuous Survey of machinery, the procedure depends whether the PMS is approved or not:
Approved Machinery Planned Maintenance Scheme (MPMS) Class Approval required for specific items of machinery to be examined by the Chief Engineer without the presence of Class surveyor.
Non – Approved Machinery Planned Maintenance Scheme. Does not require class approval. Where possible Class should perform surveys, Where Class attendance is not possible the Chief Engineer can perform inspection which must then be credited by Class.
Planned Maintenance System (Condition Monitoring) PMS(CM). Under either the PMS or PMS(CM) “alternative” survey systems vessels will carry the appropriate Class notations but in either case, a specific Class approval certificate for the PMS will not be issued.
Where PMS notation is included in the Certificate of Class, then the latest version of the PMS installed on board and the Type Approval certificate for the specific PMS version should be available on board. </Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>The shipsoft PMS must be uptodate in all respects. This has been the most frequent observation in the past. Running hours especially of different jobs on main and auxiliary engines should show no over due. If overdue, a condition monitoring process should be in place.

Specific attention is required for critical jobs &amp; spares.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Is the fuel system fitted with valves that are capable of being closed from outside the machinery space and are they regularly tested and in good order?</Question>
    <Guidance>Oil fuel pipes, which, if damaged, would allow oil to escape from a storage, settling or daily service tank having a capacity of 500 l and above situated above the double bottom, shall be fitted with a cock or valve directly on the tank capable of being closed from a safe position outside the space concerned in the event of a fire occurring in the space in which such tanks are situated. (SOLAS II-2.4.2.2.3.4)
Notes: The method of valve closure should be able to operate in the absence of power from the vessels normal or emergency generators sets and may utilise pneumatic/ hydraulic stored power or the use of valves wheels located outside of the machinery space and fitted with reach-rods to the shut-off valves. In either case, it is important that the remote means of closure are tested regularly from the remote position and proven to operate correctly. In the case of power operated valves that are operated using a hydraulic hand pump, sufficient hydraulic oil must be available to ensure that all valves served by the system can be fully closed. The position and identification of each of the closing devices must be clearly marked. Records should be checked to verify that testing has taken place. Personnel must be questioned to ensure that the use of these devices is fully understood.</Guidance>

    <Question>Is the general condition, visual appearance and cleanliness of the hull satisfactory.</Question>
    <Guidance>In the event of accidental or other exceptional discharge of oil, a statement shall be made in the Oil Record Book Part II of the circumstances of, and the reasons for, the discharge. (Oil Record Books Introduction Parts I and II).
Note: The hull should be free from oil staining, extensive coating breakdown or excessive marine growth. Record in comments approximate percentage coating breakdown or areas of marine growth. The hull may be oil stained by passing through an area of oil and not be recorded in the Oil record book. If the hull is stained in this way, record of passing through oil areas should be recorded in the oil record book if such transit occurred during daylight hours.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>1. The inspector’s first impressions are formed between the gangway and the Master’s cabin or ship’s office - never underestimate this route;2. Even if the hull has rust stains, make sure the Ship`s name, Port of Registry and ( Very Important), the Load Line markings are painted and visible. 3. Inspector looks for stains from Cargo on the ship side. This indicates either loss of containment from the ship`s tanks or discharge of chemicals over the deck or from the manifold. Make sure there are no such cargo stains on the ship side and report to office during preparation for the inspection if any are noticed.4. If you get an observation in this section and the vessel is due for docking shortly, make sure you point this out to the inspector and he writes this comment it in his observation. Show him the Dry docking spec that this job is included.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Is the general condition of service pipework satisfactory and is it free from significant corrosion and pitting and soft patches or other temporary repairs?</Question>
    <Guidance>Notes: The following deck pipework should be examined, particularly on the underside, for external indications of corrosion and for patching or accelerated wear caused by rope abrasion:
• Hydraulic and pneumatic pipework;
• Fire mains and associated fittings;
• Deck steam lines;
• Compressed air lines;
• Tank cleaning lines.
Pipe securing arrangements should be intact and permit free movement of the pipes as necessary.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Pay special attention to the cosmetic appearance of the pipelines. Even spot rust or rust weeping from the catwalk give a very poor impression.

NO SOFT PATCHES ON ANY PIPELINES ARE ACCEPTABLE. You must have permanent repair done on any leak. If a leak occurs just before or during an inspection and permanent repair is not possible, do temporary repair, make a defect report and a risk assessment. 

Make sure you have information on cosmetic up gradation ready to show the inspector. It is important that the inspector sees a cosmetic maintenance plan and makes note of it in his observation if he has any comments about rust on the pipelines.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Are pipe stands, clamps, supports and expansion arrangements satisfactory?</Question>
    <Guidance />
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Loose or missing clamps and supports can cause vibration and at the point where the clamp holds the pipe, a fracture and leak can occur. Make sure the pipe is well supported along its length.

At the point where the clamp or support holds a pipe, there is usually rust due to lack of maintenance. If there is evidence of such rust use proper tools (such as hydro blaster or jet chisel) to de-rust and then apply proper coating in that area. For cases of severe rusting it may be necessary to dismantle the pipe and fit back after de-rusting. If the vessel is close to its scheduled docking consult office for inclusion in the dry dock repair list.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Are all deck openings, including watertight doors and portholes, in good order and capable of being properly secured?</Question>
    <Guidance />
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Any observation in this question will also affect your Statutory Load line Certificate. It is imperative that all water tight openings can be shut and are indeed water tight. Inspectors also look for evidence of poor or no maintenance and give an observation to this effect.

Manhole covers on deck are prone to rust around the nuts due to frequent opening and closing. Pay special attention to these areas.

Besides rust, you must also pay attention to the condition of the rubber or other packing which contribute to the water tightness. Loose or missing packing is NOT ACCEPTABLE and must be replaced immediately.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Is the general condition, visual appearance and cleanliness of the superstructure satisfactory?</Question>
    <Guidance />
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Superstructure includes internal accommodation as well as the external appearance of bulkheads and accommodation decks.

An inspector spends about 8 - 10 hours on board out of which several hours are spent inside the accommodation. It is therefore VERY IMPORTANT that accommodation is VERY CLEAN, toilets and galley spotless and free of any bad odour. 

Toilets which will be accessible to the inspector must be prepared with hand towels and soap for use by the inspector. All crockery and linen for use by inspector must be spotless and without any signs of damage.

One day prior to the inspection, all crew must participate in the cleaning and preparation of the accommodation for the inspection as any unclean cabin or personal toilet may also cause an odour inside the accommodation.  
A clean accommodation on entry by the inspector and some excellent service by the Mess man and Cook will keep him in a good mood throughout the inspection.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Is deck lighting adequate?</Question>
    <Guidance>Notes: The level of deck lighting should be adequate to allow:
• Sufficient visibility to permit safe access to all areas of the deck
• The safe use of mooring equipment;
• The monitoring of the deck area for spills and leakages;
• The monitoring of all deck areas and the adjacent surrounding areas to prevent unauthorized access.</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>The adequacy of the deck lighting is as per the requirements when the ship was built. It is however important that there are NO MISSING LAMPS in any areas, especially those where the inspector is likely to inspect. Good lighting is part of safety and hence must be given importance. When preparing for an inspection make sure you have sufficient spare lamps including those for deck mast lights. One day prior to the inspection, you must check again for any fused lamps as it is often that we have an observation because an inspector notes a fused lamp but not the ship staff.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Are light fittings in gas-hazardous areas Ex 'd' rated and in good order?</Question>
    <Guidance>Notes: Lights will be either explosion-proof or pressurised. The flame paths of explosion-proof lights should not be painted over. Fluorescent fittings will generally have flame paths at each end.
The manufacturer’s or Administration’s certificate approving the fitting for use in gas-hazardous areas will be invalidated if the correct bolts for securing the cover, or the correct light bulb size, are not used. 
Particular attention should be paid to the following:
• Cracks in metal, cracked or broken glasses or failure of cement around cemented glasses in flameproof or explosion proof enclosures;
• Covers of flameproof enclosures to ensure that they are tight, that no bolts are missing, and that no gaskets are present between mating metal surfaces;
• Each connection to ensure that it is properly connected;
• Possible slackness of joints in conduit runs and fittings;
Vent fan, cargo pump and cargo winch motors and lighting are likely to be found within gas-hazardous areas. An Ex‘d’ rating means that the equipment can withstand an internal explosion without igniting the outside atmosphere. Ex ‘e’ is an increased safety rating.</Guidance>

    <Question>If fitted, is the Ship's Hospital clean and tidy and ready for use?</Question>
    <Guidance>Note: The Ship's hospital should be ready for immediate use. The Ship's hospital should not be used as an additional cabin or used as a store room. If the vessel is not equipped with a Ship's hospital answer the question 'NA'</Guidance>
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Follow VIQ guidance. A common observation in this category is odour from the toilet, water seal of the toilet dry (toilet is not flushed for a long period), stained toilet bowl or wash basin and Hospital was locked.

A regular inspection of the Hospital should be done and the wash basin as well as the toilet tried out frequently so that it is known to be functional. DO NOT USE HOSPITAL FOR ANY OTHER USE.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Is the level of accommodation lighting satisfactory?</Question>
    <Guidance />
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>The adequacy of the lighting inside the accommodation is as per the requirements when the ship was built. It is however important that there are NO MISSING BULBS OR TUBELIGHTS in any areas, especially those where the inspector is likely to inspect. Good lighting is part of safety and hence must be given importance. When preparing for an inspection make sure you have sufficient spare lamps on board. One day prior to the inspection, you must check again for any fused lamps as it is often that we have an observation because an inspector notes a fused lamp but not the ship staff.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Is the condition of electrical equipment in the accommodation satisfactory?</Question>
    <Guidance />
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Poor condition of Electrical equipment can be a safety hazard and must be immediately attended to. Look for any detached light fittings in the cabins, galley  or alleyways. Also pay attention to the insulation panel to see that there are no earth faults in the system. This is a common observation by vetting inspectors.</OfficeRemarks>

    <Question>Are personnel alarms in refrigerated spaces in good order and operational?</Question>
    <Guidance />
    <PreVetting>0</PreVetting>
    <OfficeRemarks>Every reefer room is fitted with an alarm which can be sounded by a person FROM INSIDE THE REEFER ROOM if he cannot open the door from inside for any reason. These alarms MUST be tested every week during the inspection of the accommodation by the Master. In addition, the condition of the reefer door must be kept in a manner that opening and closing can be done with minimum effort and as designed. No excessive force or additional tools (such as crowbar) should be necessary to open the door. Freezing around the door channels and condensation should be investigated and stopped.</OfficeRemarks>

    <ShipComments>Yes, Ship Board Manual Vol.2 Bridge Procedures and Routines: 6 Underkeel Clearance (UKC) Courses / routes for the different parts of a Passage are to be laid down tocomply with the following minimum safe Under Keel Clearance (UKC): Deep sea passages (with depth more than 100 mtrs): Five times the deepest draft. Coastal passages (in depths more than 50 mtrs) : Twice the deepest draft. Approaches to Port (depths less than 50 mtrs) / Outside port limit : 15% of deepest draft. (Tide and Squat are to be considered when calculating the UKC). Within port limits : while underway, at SPM (Sngle Point Mooring) Buoys and at anchorages (with or without pilot on board) : 10% of the deepest draught. (Tide and Squat are to be considered when calculating theUKC). At Berth in ports: 60cm UKC.While transiting Canals – as per local navigation rules If the above UKC cannot be maintained for any reason then office is to be contacted immediately for advise. (Section 0030, 6) An entry to effect is to be made in the deck log book. (Section 0030, 6) To avoid grounding at the port; as much ballast as possible to be pumped out before low water at load port and ballasting to be delayed as much as possible at the discharge port. (Section 0030, 6) Harmonic Constant Tables to be used to calculate height of tide and available depth of water at particular time. interpolation of heights and times is NOT TO BE USED. (Section 0030, 6) Calculations to be independently checked by master. (Section 0030, 6) At least following to be taken into account while calculating minimum required UKC: (Section 0030, 6) The predicted height of tide. Changes in predicted tidal height which is caused by wind speed and direction and high and low barometric pressure. Nature and stability of bottom. Accuracy of hydrographical information. Change of water density and increase in draft due to fresh water allowance. Vessel size, handling characteristic and increase in draft due to heel. Wave response allowance. Reliability of draft observation and calculation including hogging and sagging. Reduced depth over pipe lines and other obstructions. Due to certain circumstances such as sustained wind force and direction, abnormally high pressures etc.; available depth, in approaches or in rivers/ canals, may be less than charted depths. Port authorities/ Pilots/ Agents must be consulted to verify the facts and minimum required UKC to be calculated taking it into account. (Section 0030, 6) Passage Plan and Form B018 and B017

    <ShipComments>Ship Board Manual Vol.2 Bridge Procedures and Routines INTERVALS OF POSITION FIXING WITHIN THE PASSAGE PLAN Form B018 has a page for Navigation information between different waypoints. These information shall be different for Ocean Passages, Coastal Passages and Confined Waters Passages. Among the differences, the interval requirements for the different areas will be one of the most obvious ones and these requirements should be entered in the Remarks section of the page. As many of these pages as necessary are to be used to cover all areas and the different intervals of position fixing times, as well as other required information, taking into consideration the area to be navigated. 4.

    <ShipComments>Lifeboat on-load release gear are well maintained in accordance with instructions for on-board maintenance as required by SOLAS. Subjected to a thorough examination and operational test during the annual surveys by properly trained personnel familiar with the system; and operationally tested under a load of 1.1 times the total mass of the lifeboat when loaded with its full complement of person and equipment whenever the release gear is overhauled. Such overhauling and test are carried out at least once every five years.   On-load release gear if correctly used and maintained is a vital and reliable element for safety. If Incorrectly operated, or neglected , it can easily become a real danger to life. Documents On-load release rear maintenance record.

    <ShipComments>Each survival craft were stowed in a state of continuous readiness so that two crew members can carry out preparations for embarkation and launching in less than 5 minutes.   Each lifeboat were launched with its assigned operating crew aboard and maneuvered in the water at least once every three months during an abandon ship drill.  In the case of a Free fall Life boats ,at least once every three months during an abandon ship drill, the crew  boards the lifeboat, properly secure themselves in their seats and commence launch procedures up to, but not including, the actual release of the lifeboat (i.e., the release hook shall not be released).   The lifeboat shall then either be free-fall launched with only the required operating crew on board, or lowered into the water by means of the secondary means of launching with or without the operating crew on board.   In both cases, the lifeboat shall thereafter be manoeuvred in the water by the operating crew.   At intervals of not more than six months, the lifeboat were launched by free fall with only the operating crew on board, or simulated launching shall be carried out in accordance with the guidelines developed by the IMO   Emergency lighting for mustering and abandonment shall be tested at each abandon ship drill.</ShipComments>

    <ShipComments>With respect to launching equipment, rescue boats either have two release capabilities, one off-load and one on-load, or only one if the rescue boat can only be released when waterborne. The on-load release are protected against accidental or premature use; To prevent a premature on-load release, on-load operation of the release mechanism require a sustained and deliberate action by the operator; To prevent an accidental release the mechanical protection (interlock) should only engage when the release mechanism is properly and completely set;  The release mechanism were designed that crew members in the lifeboat can clearly observe when the release mechanism is properly and completely reset; Clear operating instructions were provided with a suitable worded warning notice; Where a single fall or hook system is used for launching, the above requirements need not apply and a single capability to release the rescue boat only when it is waterborne will be adequate.

    <ShipComments>Each liferaft were stowed with a float-free arrangement so that each floats free and if inflatable, inflates automatically when the ship sinks. It is achieved by means of a hydrostatic release Unit (HRU). It will operate at 4 Meter deep water pressure and allow L/Raft to be float free.   After L/Raft is inflated and painter is tight, weak link will break at force of 2.2 +/- 0.4 Kn and L/R is casted away from sinking ship.   Liferafts were stowed as to permit manual release of raft or container at a time from their securing arrangements. Liferafts stowed in the forward part for crew working there at fore of the vessel do not require a HRU. IT is to be launched manually and embarked by means of embarkation ladder.   HRU must be replaced 2 years from the month of installation onboard. Month and year marking shall be made on the HRU when replaced. References Maker’s Instructions. Form S101 A or B</ShipComments>
